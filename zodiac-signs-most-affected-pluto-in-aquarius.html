Despite being demoted from planet to “dwarf” planet, the intensity of its influence has nothing to do with its size. If you’re one of the <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">zodiac signs most affected by Pluto in Aquarius</a>, then get ready for one of the most life-changing astrological transits you’ll ever go through.</p><p>Pluto may be considered Lord of the Underworld, but you should never judge a book by its cover. Despite being the <a href=#>planet of death </a><a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">and</a><a href=#> rebirth</a>, Pluto’s impact is largely neutral rather than inherently positive or negative. Pluto is simply a planet that alchemizes one thing and transforms it into another. Death and rebirth <a href=#>can mean </a><a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">many</a><a href=#> things</a>, such as give and take, starting and stopping as well as ending and beginning. Just when you think you know all there is to know, Pluto shines a light on all the secrets lingering in the shadows, lifting up the rock and showing you all the pests skulking underneath. You can’t deny the truth once Pluto makes sure it’s staring right at you.</p><p>Pluto is a generational planet that <a href=#>shapes the </a><a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">larger</a><a href=#> trends of humanity</a>. For example, millennials were born while Pluto was in Scorpio and Generation Z is associated with being born during Pluto in Sagittarius. And when Pluto enters Aquarius, it will inspire game-changing innovations and encourage us to redirect our society toward more community-oriented ideals. Because this is the first time Pluto has entered a new zodiac sign since 2008, this shift will also coincide with revolutionary surges that propel us toward the future. And will this future look better or worse than what we have now? Well, that decision is entirely up to you.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/stylecaster.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/12/Copy-of-List-Redirect-Design-10.png><p>Because Pluto is such a slow-moving outer planet, it only covers one to three degrees per year. Pluto made its first entry into Aquarius on March 23, 2023, which only amounted to a taste of a transit that will gradually take shape over the next 20 years. Pluto stationed retrograde on May 1, 2023 where it <a href=#>retrograded back into Capricorn</a> on June 11, 2023. However, Pluto is officially re-entering Aquarius once again on January 20, 2024, but only before again, retrograding back into Capricorn on September 1 and eventually returning Aquarius for good as of November 19, 2024. Pluto in Aquarius will wrap up this transit two decades from now, entering Pisces in 2043 and 2044.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/stylecaster.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/astrologynewslettersignup.png><h2 class=wp-block-heading id=these-4-zodiac-signs-will-feel-pluto-in-aquarius-the-most>These 4 Zodiac Signs Will Feel Pluto in Aquarius the Most</h2><p>If you’re feeling afraid of what’s to come, remember: these changes will unfold over 20 years, giving us plenty of time to adjust to them. And if your <a href=#>sun sign</a> or <a href=#>rising sign</a> happens to fall under any of the fixed signs, here’s why Pluto in Aquarius could completely transform your life:</p><ul class="pmc-fallback-list-items lrv-a-unstyle-list lrv-u-margin-t-2"><li class="pmc-fallback-list-item-wrap lrv-u-margin-b-2" readability=4.8281642917016><h2>Taurus</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/stylecaster.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/12/Taurus.png><p>If you’re a Taurus or a Taurus rising, Pluto in Aquarius will shake up your career and your overall reputation. As Pluto spends the next 20 years shining a revealing light on your 10th house of public standing, you may find yourself giving up on certain career paths and pipe dreams that haven’t been shaping up as you hoped they would. As this transit begins, you may experience certain failures or let go of certain standards you’ve set for yourself. After all, Pluto destroys before it creates, and in order for Pluto to put you in the best possible position to achieve greatness, you may have to let go of all that you once knew. And although this sounds terrifying, this is also incredibly special, Taurus. Not many of us will get to experience Pluto crossing their midheaven, which can lead to money, power and glory if you’re willing to embrace an entirely different brand and career structure. Remember: Pluto literally means “wealth” in Greek. By the time this transit is over, you’ll get to see all the ways in which Pluto has been setting you up for fame and excellence. <a rel="noreferrer noopener" href=#>Read your full 2024 yearly horoscope here</a>.</p></li><li class="pmc-fallback-list-item-wrap lrv-u-margin-b-2" readability=4.3405358686258><h2>Leo</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/stylecaster.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/12/Leo.png><p>Your relationships are being put under a microscope as Pluto in Aquarius begins. Over the course of the next 20 years, Pluto will force you to reckon with the skeletons in your closet, especially if they’ve been preventing you from truly cultivating a strong and healthy partnership. If you’re a Leo or Leo rising, Pluto in Aquarius could lead to major ups and downs in your love life, social life and your one-on-one relationships, but that’s not necessarily a bad thing. You’re ready for people to reveal their true selves to you. During this transit, your true friends and allies will reveal themselves just as much as your haters and secret enemies will. And by the time Pluto in Aquarius comes to an end in the year 2044, you may feel way more confident about your relationships, knowing that you’ve spent the last two decades nurturing the ones that matter all while separating yourself and learning from the ones that did not. And by the way, this transit could also introduce you to some wealthy and well-connected partners, lovers and friends. <a rel="noreferrer noopener" href=#>Read your full 2024 yearly horoscope here</a>.</p></li><li class="pmc-fallback-list-item-wrap lrv-u-margin-b-2" readability=4.3541501976285><h2>Scorpio</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/stylecaster.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/12/Scorpio.png><p>Get ready for a major change, because Pluto in Aquarius is here to shine a light on the dustiest corners of your personal life. If you’re a Scorpio or a Scorpio rising, this transit will force you to deal with some of the family drama and conflicts associated with your emotional roots. Pluto is a planet that transforms, but in order for this transit to help you create a family dynamic and a home environment that supports your highest growth, you may have to spend the next 20 years divesting yourself from some of the bad habits you’ve picked up from family and healing from the trauma you experienced in early childhood. This sounds very heavy, and in many ways, it is, but the pay off is worth your while. You’re ready to feel at home on your own terms, Scorpio. You don’t need your relatives to be getting along or for your personal life to make sense in order for you to feel at home. Allow Pluto in Aquarius to completely transform your perspective of “home”, because it is truly where the heart is. You may also be inheriting money from relatives during this transit, so don’t be surprised if you’re suddenly included in your aunt’s will. <a rel="noreferrer noopener" href=#>Read your full 2024 yearly horoscope here</a>.</p></li><li class="pmc-fallback-list-item-wrap lrv-u-margin-b-2" readability=6.7702161729384><h2>Aquarius</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/stylecaster.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/12/Aquarius.png><p>Get ready to become a brand new version of yourself, Aquarius. By the time Pluto in Aquarius is over, you may feel like a completely different person. In fact, you might even be unrecognizable. If you’re an Aquarius or Aquarius rising, you’re about to experience something that many of us will never go through during our lifetime—Pluto crossing your ascendant. For the next 20 years, Pluto will completely transform your first house of the self, and by the time it’s over, you’ll feel stronger, more powerful and more prepared to show the world who you really are. However, in order for you to undergo this metamorphosis, you may need to spend time mourning the person you thought you were and letting go of the life you thought you would have. This will be a process and it certainly won’t happen overnight, but the change is just as exciting and validating as it is daunting. Your whole personality is about to become a trend, Aquarius, and hopefully those copy-cats know it was you who tried it first. If anyone is gonna be leading the world into this next era of history, it’s you, Aquarius. We’re all ready to follow your lead. <a rel="noreferrer noopener" href=#>Read your full 2024 yearly horoscope here</a>.</p></li></ul><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmirpK65pq%2FArKueql6YvK57y6Kqratfr7yltcCcZKyhl6PAbrnOrKtmmZabsqTAxJ1kqaSlqbxutc1mmKqtkae2tr%2BO</p><h4><i class="fas fa-share-alt" aria-hidden=true></i>&nbsp;Share!</h4><ul class=share-buttons><li><a href="https://www.facebook.com/sharer/sharer.php?u=%2fzodiac-signs-most-affected-pluto-in-aquarius.html" target=_blank title="Share on Facebook"><i class="fab fa-facebook" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Share on Facebook</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="https://twitter.com/intent/tweet?source=%2fzodiac-signs-most-affected-pluto-in-aquarius.html" target=_blank title=Tweet><i class="fab fa-twitter" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Tweet</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="https://plus.google.com/share?url=%2fzodiac-signs-most-affected-pluto-in-aquarius.html" target=_blank title="Share on Google+"><i class="fab fa-google-plus" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Share on Google+</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="http://www.tumblr.com/share?v=3&u=%2fzodiac-signs-most-affected-pluto-in-aquarius.html" target=_blank title="Post to Tumblr"><i class="fab fa-tumblr" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Post to Tumblr</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="http://pinterest.com/pin/create/button/?url=%2fzodiac-signs-most-affected-pluto-in-aquarius.html" target=_blank title="Pin it"><i class="fab fa-pinterest-p" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Pin it</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="http://www.reddit.com/submit?url=%2fzodiac-signs-most-affected-pluto-in-aquarius.html" target=_blank title="Submit to Reddit"><i class="fab fa-reddit-alien" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Submit to Reddit</span></a></li></ul><style>ul.share-buttons{list-style:none;padding:0}ul.share-buttons li{display:inline}ul.share-buttons .sr-only{position:absolute;clip:rect(1px 1px 1px 1px);clip:rect(1px,1px,1px,1px);padding:0;border:0;height:1px;width:1px;overflow:hidden}</style><div class="prev-next-post pure-g"><div class=pure-u-1-24 style=text-align:left><a href=./book-review-bodies-bogs-give-some-their-fascinating-secrets-not-all.html><i class="fa fa-chevron-left"></i></a></div><div class=pure-u-10-24><nav class=prev><a href=./book-review-bodies-bogs-give-some-their-fascinating-secrets-not-all.html>Book review: the bodies in the bogs give up some of their fascinating secrets but not all</a></nav></div><div class=pure-u-2-24>&nbsp;</div><div class=pure-u-10-24><nav class=next><a href=./jersey-shore-ronnie-magro-ortiz-sammi-sweetheart-reunion.html>'Jersey Shore' Stars Ronnie and Sammi Back Under Same Roof for Show</a></nav></div><div class=pure-u-1-24 style=text-align:right><a href=./jersey-shore-ronnie-magro-ortiz-sammi-sweetheart-reunion.html><i class="fa fa-chevron-right"></i></a></div></div></div></div></div><script src=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/blackburn/js/ui.js></script>
