But no, it's real. And what's also real is the disappointment to see something as sacred and as special as I thought was the relationship I had with my kids' father and see that turned into something vulgarized and cheapened by the media. And all of this while my dad has been in the ICU and I've been fighting on different fronts.

And I did it. I put my career in second gear and I came to Spain, to support him so he could play football and win titles. And it was a sacrifice of love," Shakira said. "Thanks to that, my kids were able to have a present mom, and I have this amazing bond with them that is unbreakable and that sustains us. You know, that is it. That's all I can say."</p><h2 data-node-id=33 class="body-h2 css-p3fpzg emevuu60">June 2022: They call it quits.</h2><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=34 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">To fans' surprise, the singer and soccer star dropped the sudden news that they had broken up after 12 years together.
