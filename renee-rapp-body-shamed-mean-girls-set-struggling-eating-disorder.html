It got so bad, her parents went to New York to try and convince her to quit.</p><p>Mean Girls opened in April 2018 and wrapped in March 2020 due to the COVID-19 pandemic. Rapp took over the role of Regina permanently in September 2019 and would remain until the show shuttered. It is being adapted into a musical feature film, with Rapp having agreed to return to the role.</p><p>While there was a part of her grateful that she was able to step away from the show, her parents are "more worried than they have ever been," in part because she's shifting her focus to her music, but also perhaps because she's stepping back into another version of Mean Girls.</p><p>"Eating disorders don’t just go away and like, you’re healed, like: ‘Sorry, I can eat again, ha ha!,'" Rapp told the outlet. "It’s a lifelong thing. There are battles with addiction and whatever everywhere."</p><a class="article-block__link js-track-link" href=# data-node-ref=toofab:article:431b7acf-2d12-4d8d-ae3b-0be544f67e57 data-container-ref=toofab:article:36086b2e-6a09-4d4c-ac0c-34cd33b6e168 data-context='{"section":"article-block","name":"article"}' readability=27><img src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/images.toofab.com/image/13/5by4/2023/07/10/13bfe8c1080940dbb036f53a30ce0b7d_xs.jpg width=300 height=240 style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center><p><h4 class=article-block__card-title>Renee Rapp Exiting Sex Lives of College Girls During Season 3</h4><span class=article-block__cta-text>View Story</span></p></a><p>"I still struggle with it, but at least my parents know that I’ve been taken out of environments that were really harmful to my sickness, which is awesome and a huge win," she continued. "They worry like hell, but they’re chilling, I guess."</p><p>Rapp is also cognizant of her potential vulnerabilities as she looks ahead to being able to work on the feature film. "My biggest thing right now is trying to prepare myself to go into the filming environment with a way healthier mindset," she told <a href=#><strong>NME</strong></a> in January. "Because I don’t want to fall back into anything."</p><p>She said she felt it was important to speak up about her eating disorder after suffering "in silence for so many years," in part to push back against some of the culture of the younger generations.</p><p>"My generation and the generation that will follow mine is much more open — especially women, non-men, queer people," she said. "I do think I’ve been afforded more opportunities than women before me, men and queer women before me. This generation is still super mean to each other, but we are more outspoken — and give less of a f--k."</p><p>Rapp recently stepped away from another project, her starring role on The Sex Lives of College Girls in Season 3 to focus on her music. The actress and musician released her debut album Snow Angel on August 18.</p><a id=gallery-link-5406eac2-fb32-4e71-bddf-b9fc05b9a10d class="media-link gallery-block__link js-track-link js-click-gallery" href=# data-node-ref=toofab:gallery:5406eac2-fb32-4e71-bddf-b9fc05b9a10d data-context='{"name":"gallery-block","section":"permalink"}' data-container-ref=toofab:article:36086b2e-6a09-4d4c-ac0c-34cd33b6e168 data-gallery-layout=carousel><img src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/images.toofab.com/image/12/4by3/2023/08/22/127ed13112fc4857b2e0b816c672324c_md.jpg width=825 height=618 style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center></a><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmisn6Szoq6NnKamZ2Jlf3R7j3Fma21fp7KvscRmqZqooGKvsLDYZqqhmZ2asW65xJqlZp%2BZp7m0edKeq2arpKfCqLPLoqWgZZWWwaq6xmaboqufp7Gmvo4%3D</p><h4><i class="fas fa-share-alt" aria-hidden=true></i>&nbsp;Share!</h4><ul class=share-buttons><li><a href="https://www.facebook.com/sharer/sharer.php?u=%2frenee-rapp-body-shamed-mean-girls-set-struggling-eating-disorder.html" target=_blank title="Share on Facebook"><i class="fab fa-facebook" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Share on Facebook</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="https://twitter.com/intent/tweet?source=%2frenee-rapp-body-shamed-mean-girls-set-struggling-eating-disorder.html" target=_blank title=Tweet><i class="fab fa-twitter" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Tweet</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="https://plus.google.com/share?url=%2frenee-rapp-body-shamed-mean-girls-set-struggling-eating-disorder.html" target=_blank title="Share on Google+"><i class="fab fa-google-plus" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Share on Google+</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="http://www.tumblr.com/share?v=3&u=%2frenee-rapp-body-shamed-mean-girls-set-struggling-eating-disorder.html" target=_blank title="Post to Tumblr"><i class="fab fa-tumblr" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Post to Tumblr</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="http://pinterest.com/pin/create/button/?url=%2frenee-rapp-body-shamed-mean-girls-set-struggling-eating-disorder.html" target=_blank title="Pin it"><i class="fab fa-pinterest-p" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Pin it</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="http://www.reddit.com/submit?url=%2frenee-rapp-body-shamed-mean-girls-set-struggling-eating-disorder.html" target=_blank title="Submit to Reddit"><i class="fab fa-reddit-alien" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Submit to Reddit</span></a></li></ul><style>ul.share-buttons{list-style:none;padding:0}ul.share-buttons li{display:inline}ul.share-buttons .sr-only{position:absolute;clip:rect(1px 1px 1px 1px);clip:rect(1px,1px,1px,1px);padding:0;border:0;height:1px;width:1px;overflow:hidden}</style><div class="prev-next-post pure-g"><div class=pure-u-1-24 style=text-align:left><a href=./tgi-fridays-traybake-desserts-now-23924832.html><i class="fa fa-chevron-left"></i></a></div><div class=pure-u-10-24><nav class=prev><a href=./tgi-fridays-traybake-desserts-now-23924832.html>TGI Fridays traybake desserts are now on sale at Tesco and they look delicious</a></nav></div><div class=pure-u-2-24>&nbsp;</div><div class=pure-u-10-24><nav class=next><a href=./monmouth-roseville-titans-slam-ridgewood-spartans-55-24.html>Monmouth-Roseville Titans slam Ridgewood Spartans 55-24</a></nav></div><div class=pure-u-1-24 style=text-align:right><a href=./monmouth-roseville-titans-slam-ridgewood-spartans-55-24.html><i class="fa fa-chevron-right"></i></a></div></div></div></div></div><script src=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/blackburn/js/ui.js></script>
