Currently, there are diesel-free cities whereby automobiles running on such fuel are prohibited. Is this program achievable in Africa, more so in Kenya? Although it is hard spotting electric cars in Kenya, the switch has already begun. Without a doubt, Kenya’s transport sector is gearing up for the paradigm shift to electric automobiles. Can electric cars work in Kenya?

Most manufacturers build their electric cars according to different driver's needs.</p><p class=align-left>Regardless of how they are made, the significant feature of such vehicles is that the driver can plug them to charge from an off-board electric power source.

There are two <a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">main categories </a>of EVs:</p><h3>All-electric vehicles (AEVs)</h3><p class=align-left>AEVs source their entire power from electric motors. Therefore, they possess a battery pack that stores all the electrical energy produced by the motor. Ordinarily, they get their electricity from an electric grid after plugging them in.</p><p class=align-left>There do not consume any petroleum-based fuel hence do not produce any carbon or exhaust. BEVs (Battery Electric Vehicles) and FCEVs (Fuel Cell Electric Vehicles) fall in this category.</p><h3>Plug-in hybrid electric vehicles (PHEVs)</h3><p class=align-left>PHEVs utilize both electricity and fuel to power the car. Usually, a battery powers the motor charged from an electrical grid. On the other hand, the vehicle possesses a fuel compartment utilized to power the internal combustion engine.</p><a class=c-article-read-also__image-wrapper href=#><img sizes=256px style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/netstorage-tuko.akamaized.net/images/ff222501a918b0dc.jpg></a><a class=c-article-read-also__headline href=# readability=27><p class=c-article-read-also__caption>Read also</p><p class=c-article-read-also__headline-wrapper><span class=c-article-read-also__headline-hover-inner>Everything you need to know about motorbikes for sale in Kenya</span></p></a><p class=align-left><strong>READ ALSO: </strong>5 types of drivers that drive us crazy</p><h2>Are there electric cars in Kenya?</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/netstorage-tuko.akamaized.net/images/c5ccdb75456c7e39.jpg><p class=align-left>In 2016, Francis Romano surprised the Kenyan customs department by importing an electric car.
