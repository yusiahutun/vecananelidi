<time>04 Sep 2024, 00:00</time></div></div><p>The effort it takes to dry and style hair can be time-sapping and exhausting. That’s especially true if you have fine or thin hair and want to achieve a voluminous hairstyle. And not only that, but it also feels like we need multiple tools to style our hair from a straightener, curling iron, blow dryer, diffuser and more. Luckily, recent innovations in hair tools are popping up and they’re called multistylers since they are multiple hot tools in one convenient device. The most popular one is the Dyson Airwrap, but it comes with a hefty price tag of $600. We certainly don’t want to spend that much for gorgeous hair and know you don’t too either! So we rounded up 5 of our favorite multistylers that are considered to be Dyson Airwrap dupe so you can score a salon-quality hairstyle at a fraction of the cost.</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading>What is the Dyson Airwrap?</h2><p>Launched in 2018, the Dyson Airwrap multistyler is the first hair tool that can style hair in a multitude of ways. It comes with a variety of attachments — a regular blow dryer, diffuser, curling barrels, round brush and more — that can easily be swapped out depending on the hairstyle you want to create.</p><p>This multi-tool also boasts that it reduces the amount of heat damage to hair that you would get from say, blow drying and curling, because you’re only heating hair once. Plus, Dyson has built in something called intelligent heat control, which Dyson claims can <a href=#>regulate temperatures, prevent extreme heat damage and help protect shine</a>.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.firstforwomen.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2022/04/619scT-plNL._SL1500_.jpg><p>The biggest downside of the tool is that it’s costly, retailing for $599.99. And while some claim it’s worth every penny, if you’re like us, you don’t want to spend that much on a hair tool — especially when there is more affordable alternatives out there that are just as good.

But multistylers couldn’t be easier to use and they take hair from limp to luscious instantly. “The attachments on multistylers are there to do the work for you,” says celebrity hairstylist <a href=# rel=noopener>Clyde Haygood</a>. “The straightener will help smooth the hair without making it flat, while the other attachments give body and curl straight from the root.” And when hair has added volume, Haygood says it gives lift to the whole face for a more youthful appearance overall. (Click through to learn <a href=#>how to style thinning hair</a> so locks look two times thicker.)</p><p>Additionally, these all-in-one tools expose thin, delicate and aging hair to less heat since there’s no need to use multiple hot tools to create your desired hairstyle. And less heat means less damage, which prevents hair follicles from prematurely shedding or falling out. (Want to give hair a break from hot tools?

Sharper Image Revel 6-in-1 Multi-Styler</h3><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.firstforwomen.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2022/04/thumbnail_2023-07-24_MultiStyler_Lav_Wht_SI_Ecom_WHTBCKGRND_01-4.jpg><p><a href=# rel="noopener sponsored nofollow">Buy from QVC, $299.99</a></p><p>This Sharper Image multistyler is half the price of the Dyson Airwrap and is nearly identical. As a beauty editor for First for Women, I tested this tool and was surprised with the results. As someone with naturally curly hair, I was skeptical to use any type of multistyler device, as they never tend to work on my dry, frizzy hair. Tools that I’ve used in the past always leave pesky kinks toward my roots and my strands never end up looking smooth. However, this one gave me the exact opposite results — I had frizz-free, voluminous hair all the way up to my root after using the blow-dryer attachment. And, it only took around 20 minutes to do my whole head. The kit comes with six attachments: two curling barrels, a smoothing brush, a volumizing brush and a blow-dryer nozzle.</p><h3 class=wp-block-heading>2. Shark FlexStyle Multistyler</h3><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.firstforwomen.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2023/10/Screenshot-2023-10-18-at-3.42.56-PM.png><p><a href=# rel="noopener sponsored nofollow">Buy from Shark, on sale now for $259.99</a></p><p>The Shark FlexStyle is less than half the price of the Dyson product, and has gone viral on social media for its identical results. It’s an amazing Dyson Airwrap dupe, and the one thing that sets this hot tool apart? It’s customizable; Choose three attachments, such as the diffuser, curling barrels and round brush, that work for your specific hair needs. By doing this, you aren’t left with extra attachments that you’ll never use or don’t work with your hair texture. First for Women Executive Editor, Danielle Saliman, tested out this tool and says, “As someone who struggles achieving volume when styling my hair, I was highly impressed with the amount of volume I got from the FlexStyle. The flexible base allowed me to get as close to the root as possible at all angles, allowing for easy lift.”</p><p>To watch a side-by-side comparison of how the Shark tool stands up to the Dyson Airwrap, check out the below video from <a href=# rel=noopener>@Laineymariebeauty</a> on YouTube.</p><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-video is-provider-youtube wp-block-embed-youtube wp-embed-aspect-16-9 wp-has-aspect-ratio"></figure><h3 class=wp-block-heading>3. BZ 6-in-1 Hair Dryer Brush and Volumizer</h3><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.firstforwomen.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2022/04/71FHOcAdtQL._AC_SL1466_.jpg><p><a href=# rel="noopener sponsored nofollow">Buy from Amazon, $59.99</a></p><p>This Dyson Airwrap dupe is so similar that it even comes in the same color way as the <a href=# rel=noopener>first generation of the Airwrap</a>. While this option doesn’t come with barrels to curl hair like the other multistylers do, it comes with six attachments. These include 3 different size round brushes (which can be used to create a blowout or curls), a paddle brush, a smoothing brush and a regular blow-dryer nozzle. And for only $60, it’s the most affordable identical product we came across . One reviewer of this tool said on Amazon: “I absolutely love this device. It is easy to use and takes about 5 minutes to dry/style. I feel like I got it professionally done at my local salon. Great price for excellent results. Definitely recommend.”</p><h3 class=wp-block-heading>4. Hot Tools Hot Air Brush</h3><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.firstforwomen.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2022/04/SBS-007431.jpg><p><a href=# rel="noopener sponsored nofollow">Buy from Sally Beauty, $44.99</a></p><p>This round brush with a built-in blow dryer might not come with any interchangeable attachments like the Dyson Airwrap, but it does create an identical voluminous blowout. Just use on towel-dried hair on 1-inch sections and place starting at the root, pulling hair up and out as you move toward ends. Once all of hair is dry you’ll be left with a bouncy blowout that looks like you just left the salon. A shopper who bought the tool from Sally Beauty left a five-star rating saying: “Great tool. Easy to use and gives my super fine hair just the right amount of body.”</p><h3 class=wp-block-heading>5. TYMO Porta Cordless Hair Straightener Brush</h3><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.firstforwomen.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2023/10/61KK3moN3fL._AC_SL1500_.jpg><p><a href=# rel="noopener sponsored nofollow">Buy from Amazon, $44.99</a></p><p>This straightening brush perfect for travel and on the go as it’s cordless. And it comes in under $50, which is much more wallet-friendly than the Dyson Airwrap. Again, this tool isn’t a multistyler, but it will simultaneously smooth and straighten your hair in just a few strokes, which mimics the ease of the Dyson Airwrap. One reviewer on Amazon gave this straightening brush five stars saying: “I’m a teacher and don’t usually have time to do my hair in the morning. This little miracle worker takes my curly/frizzy/wavy hair to straight in 5 minutes. Perfect to use in the car before heading into work, and works great for touch ups too! It holds a charge for a while and gets hot enough to do the job…Overall, I would definitely buy it again and plan to gift a few during the holidays.”</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading>3 tips for using a Dyson Airwrap dupe</h2><h3 class=wp-block-heading>1. Start with hair that’s *almost* dry</h3><p>To get the best styling results with a multistyler and Dyson Airwrap dupe, Haygood advises styling hair that’s at least 80% dry. The reason why? Hair that is too wet or damp takes longer to style and in turn exposes strands to more damaging heat.</p><h3 class=wp-block-heading>2. Prep hair with a heat protectant</h3><p>Even though multistylers like the Sharper Image or Shark options above are better for your hair and cause less heat damage than regular hot tools, they can still inflict some heat on the hair. That’s why Haygood says it’s essential to use a good heat protectant prior to styling your hair. “Using a heat protectant is a must to keep hair at optimum health & protect from damage whether you’re using a traditional heat dryer,&nbsp;the Dyson Airwrap or a similar technology with low heat,” he says.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.firstforwomen.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2022/04/GettyImages-1227501321.jpg><p>One that Haygood swears by is PURA D’OR Argan Oil Heat Shield (<a href=# rel="noopener sponsored nofollow">Buy from PURA D’OR, $14.99</a>). “This heat shield is a weightless yet strong thermal heat protectant that doubles as a leave-in conditioner,” he says, “It also helps strengthen hair by locking in moisture and keeping it hydrated for a soft, smooth look.”</p><h3 class=wp-block-heading>3. Finish with the cool setting</h3><p>On top of using a heat protectant prior to styling hair, it’s also important to utilize the cool down feature on multistylers. The cooling off process actually sets the style, notes Haygood so it will last all day.</p><p>First For Women aims to feature only the best products and services.
