It happened after she sent word that, as Empress of India and with various Jubilee celebrations planned, she wanted some young Indian men added to her retinue of servants.</p><p class=mol-para-with-font>Among those chosen was the lowly assistant clerk from his native Agra.</p><p class=mol-para-with-font>Victoria approved the choice of tall, slim, handsome Abdul the instant she saw him attending her dinner table, at Osborne House on the Isle of Wight.</p><img id=i-8ed39332fed689a7 src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/i.dailymail.co.uk/i/pix/2017/08/14/23/4313898600000578-0-image-a-4_1502751389652.jpg height=630 width=634 alt="Victoria approved the choice of tall, slim, handsome Abdul the instant she saw him attending her dinner table, at Osborne House on the Isle of Wight. The Queen is played by Judie Dench and Abdul Karim by&nbsp;Bollywood actor Ali Fazal" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto><p class=imageCaption>Victoria approved the choice of tall, slim, handsome Abdul the instant she saw him attending her dinner table, at Osborne House on the Isle of Wight. The Queen is played by Judie Dench and Abdul Karim by&nbsp;Bollywood actor Ali Fazal</p><p class=mol-para-with-font>Their subsequent relationship is chronicled in the forthcoming film Victoria & Abdul, which stars Judi Dench as the Queen and comes 20 years after she played the same role in the acclaimed Mrs Brown. That, too, was the real-life tale of the mutual devotion between the Queen and a servant, in that case her cherished Scottish ghillie John Brown.</p><p class=mol-para-with-font>But Brown died in 1883 and evidently left a void in Victoria’s life, which Abdul enthusiastically filled. There was no physical relationship as there was between Diana and Dodi, but it was a form of love affair nonetheless. Besides, it was Abdul’s sleek, physical beauty that first attracted the ageing Queen.</p><p class=mol-para-with-font>‘Queen Victoria was not immune to good looks,’ says Michael Hunter, curator of Osborne House. ‘She loved the company of attractive people. John Brown was a striking and very masculine man. And she was just as admiring of good-looking women. For example, Eugenie, Empress of France, a famous beauty and fashion icon, was a great friend.’</p><p class=mol-para-with-font>The man the Queen knew as her beloved ‘Munshi’, or teacher, became the transcendent love of the latter years of her long life.</p><p class=mol-para-with-font>She even signed notes to him: ‘Your loving mother’. However, Victoria’s actual children, and senior courtiers, duly despised him. Where she saw a wise and loyal adviser, they saw an obsequious upstart who was determined to enrich himself.</p><p class=mol-para-with-font>Clearly, they were motivated in part by a poisonous cocktail of social snootiness and racial prejudice. But they were not all the ridiculous snobs they are made out to be in the new movie, which portrays the then Prince of Wales in particular (played by the comedian Eddie Izzard) to be almost sociopathically vindictive.</p><img id=i-707e90b54fe892bb src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/i.dailymail.co.uk/i/pix/2017/08/14/23/12BEDD86000005DC-0-image-m-8_1502751425980.jpg height=544 width=306 alt="The man the Queen knew as her beloved ¿Munshi¿, or teacher, became the transcendent love of the latter years of her long life" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto> <img id=i-eedb841a8f91fb6f src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/i.dailymail.co.uk/i/pix/2017/08/14/23/000A044200000258-0-image-m-10_1502751447481.jpg height=544 width=306 alt="She romanticised him just as she romanticised his country, and he was not slow to exploit the fact" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto><p class=imageCaption>The man the Queen knew as her beloved ‘Munshi’, or teacher, became the transcendent love of the latter years of her long life</p><p class=mol-para-with-font>Nor does the film, while immensely enjoyable, quite tell the truth about Abdul (played by the Bollywood actor Ali Fazal).</p><p class=mol-para-with-font>For the fact is that the Munshi was far from the paragon of sweetness and decency he appears to be.
