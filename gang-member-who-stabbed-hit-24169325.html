Back in 2008, 15-year-old Samantha Joseph led lovestruck Shakilus Townsend, 16, into an ambush where he was beaten with baseball bats and stabbed six times by a masked and hooded gang in Thornton Heath, South London.</p><p>The <a href=# rel=follow data-link-tracking=InArticle|Link data-content-type=section-topic>attack,</a> which had been orchestrated by Joseph’s jealous ex-boyfriend Danny McLean, saw her, McLean and five others – including Andre Thompson – handed life sentences a year later after being found guilty of the 16-year-old’s murder. Thompson, who was 17 at the time and from Norwood, South <a href=# rel=follow data-link-tracking=InArticle|Link data-content-type=section>East London</a> was given a minimum 14-year prison term which was later reduced to 13 years and three months.</p><p>The Parole Board said on Tuesday that he was “suitable” for release from prison. A document setting out the decision said: “After considering the circumstances of his offending, the progress made while in custody and the evidence presented at the hearing, the panel was satisfied that Mr Thompson was suitable for release.”</p><p><b>READ MORE:</b><a href=# rel=follow data-link-tracking=InArticle|Link data-content-type=news>'Honeytrap' killer who murdered teenage boy in Croydon freed from jail and deported</a></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/i2-prod.mylondon.news/incoming/article16148220.ece/ALTERNATES/s615b/1_samantha-joseph2JPGgallery.jpg><p>The papers described how Thompson, at the time of his crimes, had a “willingness to involve himself in violent behaviour” but during his sentence had taken part in courses to address this. Now aged 30, this was Thompson’s second parole review. He had been moved to an open prison in 2019 but was recalled to a closed prison a year later after being <a href=# rel=follow data-link-tracking=InArticle|Link data-content-type=section-topic>arrested</a> and convicted for driving offences.</p><p>He had since “behaved well” in prison and officials who took part in his review recommended he be released, the report added.<br>Thompson will be subject to restrictions on his movements and will have to adhere to a curfew, among other licence conditions.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/i2-prod.mylondon.news/article16263307.ece/ALTERNATES/s615b/1_Shakilus-Townsend-murder.jpg><p>Back in 2019, Samantha Joseph was also freed and deported back to her native Trinidad. CCTV footage from the day of the murder showed Joseph meet with Shakilus and took a bus with him. McLean was “armed to the teeth” waiting for his love rival, it was said. He had a <a href=# data-link-tracking=InArticle|Link data-content-type=section-topic>knife</a>, while a friend of his had a baseball bat and all were hooded with bandanas.</p><p>The court heard the teenager was badly beaten and knifed several times and left bleeding in the street, crying out for his mother and saying: "I don't want to die."</p><p>In 2012, <a href=# rel=nofollow>a BBC Three factual drama was made</a> to retell the horrific story. John Boyega, who played the victim, said of the story at the time: "I just want young people to see this, and I think it's very important that they do see it so that it's something to learn from and as a warning for everyone to be careful."</p><p><b>If you have a story you think we should be covering, feel free to email sylvie.wilkinson@reachplc.com</b></p><p><b><i>To keep up-to-date with all the latest London news, sign up to our newsletter</i> </b><b></b><a href=# data-link-tracking=InArticle|Link data-content-type=section> <b><i>here</i></b></a></p><h5 class="publication-theme-icon publication-theme-border">Read More</h5><h5 class="hidden related-articles publication-theme-icon publication-font">Related Articles</h5><h5 class="publication-theme-icon publication-theme-border">Read More</h5><h5 class="hidden related-articles publication-theme-icon publication-font">Related Articles</h5><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7rsXLqKWdp55ju6bD0milnq%2BjZMCwwdOhZKWnnpm8r3nNnq6sZ5eWu6h5zJ6km52iYsSpu4ysq5qakpqxbrTIrWRrbGFrhnR%2BlA%3D%3D</p><h4><i class="fas fa-share-alt" aria-hidden=true></i>&nbsp;Share!</h4><ul class=share-buttons><li><a href="https://www.facebook.com/sharer/sharer.php?u=%2fgang-member-who-stabbed-hit-24169325.html" target=_blank title="Share on Facebook"><i class="fab fa-facebook" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Share on Facebook</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="https://twitter.com/intent/tweet?source=%2fgang-member-who-stabbed-hit-24169325.html" target=_blank title=Tweet><i class="fab fa-twitter" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Tweet</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="https://plus.google.com/share?url=%2fgang-member-who-stabbed-hit-24169325.html" target=_blank title="Share on Google+"><i class="fab fa-google-plus" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Share on Google+</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="http://www.tumblr.com/share?v=3&u=%2fgang-member-who-stabbed-hit-24169325.html" target=_blank title="Post to Tumblr"><i class="fab fa-tumblr" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Post to Tumblr</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="http://pinterest.com/pin/create/button/?url=%2fgang-member-who-stabbed-hit-24169325.html" target=_blank title="Pin it"><i class="fab fa-pinterest-p" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Pin it</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="http://www.reddit.com/submit?url=%2fgang-member-who-stabbed-hit-24169325.html" target=_blank title="Submit to Reddit"><i class="fab fa-reddit-alien" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Submit to Reddit</span></a></li></ul><style>ul.share-buttons{list-style:none;padding:0}ul.share-buttons li{display:inline}ul.share-buttons .sr-only{position:absolute;clip:rect(1px 1px 1px 1px);clip:rect(1px,1px,1px,1px);padding:0;border:0;height:1px;width:1px;overflow:hidden}</style><div class="prev-next-post pure-g"><div class=pure-u-1-24 style=text-align:left><a href=./inside-rita-hayworth-and-glenn-fords-40-year-love-affair.html><i class="fa fa-chevron-left"></i></a></div><div class=pure-u-10-24><nav class=prev><a href=./inside-rita-hayworth-and-glenn-fords-40-year-love-affair.html>Inside Rita Hayworth and Glenn Ford's 40-Year Love Affair</a></nav></div><div class=pure-u-2-24>&nbsp;</div><div class=pure-u-10-24><nav class=next><a href=./465938-who-gary-woodlands-wife-gabby-granado-better.html>Who is Gary Woodland's wife?
