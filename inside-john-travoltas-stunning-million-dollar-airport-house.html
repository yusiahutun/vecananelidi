<time>28 May 2024, 00:00</time></div></div><p><strong>John Travolta’s airport house is one of a kind, allowing the iconic actor to explore his love and passion for aviation fully.</strong></p><p>Since rising to fame as a young actor, John Travolta has had a very successful career that only a few can dream of. Throughout the years, the actor has appeared in multiple blockbuster movies that have solidified his legacy in the industry. Some of his most famous films include “Pulp Fiction,” “Hairspray,” “Staying Alive,” and “Grease,” regarded as the most iconic musical of the century.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/i.pinimg.com/564x/80/bd/55/80bd55eb032685fe65379bc4aebc0f4f.jpg><p>Travolta’s remarkable career has also earned the actor lucrative sums of money, culminating in a $250 million net worth. Such an amount of money provides the opportunity to acquire expensive assets, including houses and cars, which are prevalent traits of Hollywood royalties.</p><p>However, while most celebrity mansions are famous for featuring huge theatres, bowling alleys or basketball courts, <a href=#>Travolta’s Airport mansion is one of a kind</a>. The Hollywood legend’s house sits inside the private-use airport Jumbolair Aviation Estates in Florida. Here are all the exciting details about John Travolta’s house.</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading><span class=ez-toc-section id=John_Travoltas_Airport_House></span><strong>John Travolta’s Airport House</strong><span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h2><p>Travolta’s luxurious mansion, <a href=#>situated in the Jumbolair Aviation Estates in Florida</a>, sits on 550 acres of property of the gated aviation community. Travolta and his late wife, Kelly Preston, were one of the first couples ever to purchase land on the estate.</p><p>According to The Richest, the property’s current worth is just under $16 million, although Travolta acquired 9.5 acres for $4.9 million in 2001. The land also features a 7,6500 ft runway, which makes it the longest private runway in the U.S.&nbsp;</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/i.pinimg.com/564x/b7/f4/ca/b7f4cabe064fe8bb0f365fe4bcf61103.jpg><p>The size makes it able to accommodate giant airplanes. In addition, the property houses an 8,700 sq ft conference center, about seventeen unsold estates, and a state-of-the-art gym center.&nbsp;</p><p>Meanwhile, Travolta’s house sits on 8,900 sq ft of land. The actor also extended the taxiway to his front door, which leads into two separate parking bases for planes. The “Grease” actor did this to ensure he could see his parked planes no matter what room he stood in.</p><p>The actor’s house features six bedrooms and two kitchens surrounded by three dining areas. The whole place, made of concrete and glass, took two years to complete. Also, the mansion features a swimming pool with a hot tub and a cabana around it. Travolta’s house also has a golf course.&nbsp;</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading><span class=ez-toc-section id=Travoltas_Airplane_Collection></span><strong>Travolta’s Airplane Collection</strong><span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h2><p>Besides acting, Travolta’s ultimate passion is flying. The actor fell in love with the craft at 15 when he took his first flying lessons. As he grew older, so did his passion for flying, and in 1978, the actor earned his full flying license.</p><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-video is-provider-youtube wp-block-embed-youtube wp-embed-aspect-16-9 wp-has-aspect-ratio"><p></p></figure><p>From then, the actor started collecting planes and has owned over 17 different types. Speaking about his love for everything aviation, the “Grease” actor <a href=#>explained</a>:&nbsp;</p><p><strong>“Aviation has always bailed me out of anything in my mind that is blue. I can look through an airline schedule and brochure and cheer up.”</strong></p><p>Some of the planes the actor has owned include a Boeing 707, which he bought from Australia’s famous plane company Qantas. In 2002, the actor became a goodwill ambassador for the airline. The actor also owns the Bombadier Challenger 601, which he bought in 2011.&nbsp;</p><p>Travolta also once owned a Gulfstream II; however, he donated the plane in 2012 to the Georgia Aviation Hall of Fame. The actor did this in honor of his son Jett who passed away in 2009 aged 16. Travolta also owns a Boeing 727, which costs around $24 million. His other planes include the Desert Falcon 900, an Eclipse 500, and a couple of Gulftsreams.</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading><span class=ez-toc-section id=Travolta_Has_Numerous_Airplane_Flying_Licences></span><strong>Travolta Has Numerous Airplane Flying Licences</strong><span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h2><p>In March 2022, <a href=#>Travolta</a> took to his Instagram page to announce his aeronautical credentials advancement. The actor revealed he was now licensed to fly a 737 airplane. In&nbsp; the video clip, <a href=#>Travolta said</a>:</p><p><strong>“A very proud moment in my aviation history. To add to my 747 and 707 licenses, I just received my 737 licenses, and it went very well, so just sharing my moment with you.”</strong></p><p>The announcement did not surprise the millions of fans following the actor who knew about his passion for flying.
