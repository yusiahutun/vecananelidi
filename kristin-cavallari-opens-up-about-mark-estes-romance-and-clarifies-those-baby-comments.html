"He's the hottest man I've ever seen, so I was like, 'Perfect, I'll make him my f--k buddy.' Because I didn't have one. I really haven't had one here in the four years that I've been divorced. Guys, the lack of sex in my life is real."</p><p>Fans of Cavallari will recall that she was previously married to former NFL star, Jay Cutler. The pair share sons Camden, 11, and Jaxon, 9, as well as daughter Saylor, 8.</p><p>Since then, Cavallari has dated around and was even linked to a few men, including comedian Jeff Dye, country singer Chase Rice, and <a href=#><strong>Bachelor Nation's Tyler Cameron</strong></a>, but her relationship with Estes is the first <a href=#><strong>she's gone public with</strong></a> since her 2020 divorce.</p><p>"He's also the first guy I've wanted to be taken off of the market for," she shared. "I would say I maybe dated three people and none of them I wanted to really be in a relationship with."</p><p>Despite their instant connection -- and rumblings that Cavallari would be <a href=#><strong>open to having more kids</strong></a> with Estes -- she said she isn't ready to have another child anytime soon.</p><a class="article-block__link js-track-link" href=# data-node-ref=toofab:article:1888738c-c128-48fc-9851-9ab5b8e87192 data-container-ref=toofab:article:8803df85-b694-41e1-b069-b16440b2ef78 data-context='{"section":"article-block","name":"article"}' readability=28><img src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/images.toofab.com/image/09/5by4/2024/04/10/09441cb810b84199b6e9b28c396507ec_xs.jpg width=300 height=240 style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center> <span class="media-credit article-block__media-credit">Instagram / TooFab</span><p><h4 class="article-block__card-title article-block__card-title--has-credit">Tyler Cameron Reacts to Kristin Cavallari Dating Mark Estes of The Montana Boyz (Exclusive)</h4><span class=article-block__cta-text>View Story</span></p></a><p>"It's too soon to tell," the Uncommon James founder added, clarifying her past comments about being open to having more kids with Estes. "We're just going to slow our roll and continue to date. We're in no rush. I will never rush into anything again. So no, I'm not in the works to have a new baby daddy."</p><p>Cavallari continued, "I thought that was a hard line for me. I've bent on it a little bit. The reality is I feel great. I'm 37. I think if I wanted to have another kid, I think could."</p><p>And it was Estes who changed her thinking about baby No. 4.</p><p>"Montana is the first guy in four years where I have thought, 'Hmm, maybe I would have another kid,'" she added. "Everyone else I've gone out with it's like, 'No, I'm not having any more kids.' But you meet the right person and it can change that."</p><p>While she said she doesn't have a set time frame for how long she wants to date the TikTok star before making a call about kids, Cavallari said they would need to have been together for a "substantial" amount of time before that happens.</p><p>"I'm taking it day by day, first of all. I'm sort of like, where I'm at in my mind right now is, let's assess where we are at the end of summer. That will be a decent amount of time," Cavallari explained, before sharing the reason the fairly fresh couple has already talked about future kids. "We had the kid conversation because I've had the kid conversation with anyone I go out with. Anyone I go on a date with in the last four years, that comes up because I'm not trying to waste someone's time."</p><a class="article-block__link js-track-link" href=# data-node-ref=toofab:article:d2f24242-abe4-4e81-a7cd-28e7dc76a544 data-container-ref=toofab:article:8803df85-b694-41e1-b069-b16440b2ef78 data-context='{"section":"article-block","name":"article"}' readability=27><img src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/images.toofab.com/image/f4/5by4/2024/04/08/f4682d95ed1a4f9891fba2b74e713163_xs.jpg width=300 height=240 style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center> <span class="media-credit article-block__media-credit">Instagram</span><p><h4 class="article-block__card-title article-block__card-title--has-credit">Mark Estes Gushes Over The Idea of Possibly Having Kids With Kristin Cavallari</h4><span class=article-block__cta-text>View Story</span></p></a><p>And when it comes to having those potential kids, Cavallari said she's leaving that "up to the universe."</p><p>"I have not frozen my eggs. Obviously, I thought I was done having kids and I don't know if I am or not," she said. "It's too soon to tell. But I do not plan on freezing my eggs. I'm not going to. I sort of figure if I'm supposed to have another baby, I will. I'm just gonna kind of leave things up to the universe."</p><p>While Cavallari acknowledged that the couple's months-long romance has gotten serious fast, she also acknowledged that they could be "done in six months," or on the flip side, they "could end up getting married."</p><p>"Who the f--k knows what's going to happen?" she said.</p><p>As for Estes, while appearing on <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer"><strong>Watch What Happens Live</strong></a> with Andy Cohen Tuesday, he said their relationship is "as serious as serious gets," adding that they've been "dating a couple months."</p><a id=gallery-link-9717dcbb-8907-40ee-bc7b-b42d20c0ad61 class="media-link gallery-block__link js-track-link js-click-gallery" href=# data-node-ref=toofab:gallery:9717dcbb-8907-40ee-bc7b-b42d20c0ad61 data-context='{"name":"gallery-block","section":"permalink"}' data-container-ref=toofab:article:8803df85-b694-41e1-b069-b16440b2ef78 data-gallery-layout=carousel><img src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/images.toofab.com/image/49/4by3/2024/04/15/4934fa5fe9164f59b6d5a489e9a0363a_md.jpg width=825 height=618 style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center></a><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmisn6Szoq6NnKamZ2Jlf3V7j21mam9foL%2Bqv9OipWabkauurbjAq6Bmp6Cau7R51KlkmpqfqsFuucCromado6mytHnRqKSappOaeqK6w2aapZminrOqsdJmq6Gno5p6o63BsmScp52isq%2FA0mg%3D</p><h4><i class="fas fa-share-alt" aria-hidden=true></i>&nbsp;Share!</h4><ul class=share-buttons><li><a href="https://www.facebook.com/sharer/sharer.php?u=%2fkristin-cavallari-opens-up-about-mark-estes-romance-and-clarifies-those-baby-comments.html" target=_blank title="Share on Facebook"><i class="fab fa-facebook" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Share on Facebook</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="https://twitter.com/intent/tweet?source=%2fkristin-cavallari-opens-up-about-mark-estes-romance-and-clarifies-those-baby-comments.html" target=_blank title=Tweet><i class="fab fa-twitter" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Tweet</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="https://plus.google.com/share?url=%2fkristin-cavallari-opens-up-about-mark-estes-romance-and-clarifies-those-baby-comments.html" target=_blank title="Share on Google+"><i class="fab fa-google-plus" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Share on Google+</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="http://www.tumblr.com/share?v=3&u=%2fkristin-cavallari-opens-up-about-mark-estes-romance-and-clarifies-those-baby-comments.html" target=_blank title="Post to Tumblr"><i class="fab fa-tumblr" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Post to Tumblr</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="http://pinterest.com/pin/create/button/?url=%2fkristin-cavallari-opens-up-about-mark-estes-romance-and-clarifies-those-baby-comments.html" target=_blank title="Pin it"><i class="fab fa-pinterest-p" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Pin it</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="http://www.reddit.com/submit?url=%2fkristin-cavallari-opens-up-about-mark-estes-romance-and-clarifies-those-baby-comments.html" target=_blank title="Submit to Reddit"><i class="fab fa-reddit-alien" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Submit to Reddit</span></a></li></ul><style>ul.share-buttons{list-style:none;padding:0}ul.share-buttons li{display:inline}ul.share-buttons .sr-only{position:absolute;clip:rect(1px 1px 1px 1px);clip:rect(1px,1px,1px,1px);padding:0;border:0;height:1px;width:1px;overflow:hidden}</style><div class="prev-next-post pure-g"><div class=pure-u-1-24 style=text-align:left><a href=./chelsea-lazkani-outfits-selling-sunset.html><i class="fa fa-chevron-left"></i></a></div><div class=pure-u-10-24><nav class=prev><a href=./chelsea-lazkani-outfits-selling-sunset.html>We Need to Talk About Chelsea Lazkani's Outfits on Selling Sunset</a></nav></div><div class=pure-u-2-24>&nbsp;</div><div class=pure-u-10-24><nav class=next><a href=./jeremy-renner-addresses-gay-rumours-bad-custody-battle-daughter-ava-lost-virginity-html.html>Jeremy Renner addresses gay rumours and his 'bad' custody battle</a></nav></div><div class=pure-u-1-24 style=text-align:right><a href=./jeremy-renner-addresses-gay-rumours-bad-custody-battle-daughter-ava-lost-virginity-html.html><i class="fa fa-chevron-right"></i></a></div></div></div></div></div><script src=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/blackburn/js/ui.js></script>
