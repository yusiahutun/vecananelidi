<time>04 Apr 2024, 00:00</time></div></div><p id=par-1_67>Over the years, <a href=#>Taylor Swift</a> fans have wisely learned to expect the unexpected. Given that the <a href=#>queen of easter eggs</a> is smart, hard-working, and strategic, she has a penchant for keeping her millions of fans on their toes. Still, no one could’ve predicted the <a href=#>“All Too Well” singer</a> releasing her album, evermore. The album debuted a mere five months after she released her Grammy award-winning album, folklore.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.cheatsheet.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/Taylor-Swift.jpg><p id=par-2_61>Naturally, Swifties were delighted that the songwriter was releasing new music. However, they were also shocked. And the reason for their surprise wasn’t merely because evermore came so quickly after folklore. It was also surprising because evermore and <a href=#>folklore</a> are so similar in sound. The sister albums belonged in the same era, which was something Swift had never done before.</p><p id=par-3_64>Shortly after dropping evermore, Swift gifted fans with another treat. She surprise-released a music video for the album’s single, “willow”. Soon after, Swift released the deluxe edition of the album with two additional songs, “right where you left me” and “it’s time to go”. Finally, she released 3 remixed versions of the “willow”. However, the promotion of the album pretty much stopped there.</p><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-rich is-provider-twitter wp-block-embed-twitter" id=emb-2><p lang=en dir=ltr>I have no idea what will come next. I have no idea about a lot of things these days and so I’ve clung to the one thing that keeps me connected to you all. That thing always has and always will be music. And may it continue, evermore. evermore is out now: <a href=#>https://t.co/QYMUTL0IAj</a> <a href=#>pic.twitter.com/tlSmahDkBi</a></p>— Taylor Swift (@taylorswift13) <a href=#>December 11, 2020</a></figure><p id=par-4_69>Since December 2019, Swift had done little to no promotion for evermore. In fact, she hasn’t even mentioned the album much. Back in May, she celebrated the album being out on vinyl, but otherwise, she hasn’t shared much about it. Instead, she’s been promoting her re-recorded albums: Fearless (Taylor’s Version) and Red (Taylor’s Version), short film: All Too Well, and new music video: “I Bet You Think About Me”.</p><p id=par-5_57>Since evermore, boasts some of Swift’s best songs and lyrics, fans would love for her to promote the album more. Some argue that the ninth album is her best, but fell under the shadow of folklore. Others simply wish that she’d stayed in the evermore era a little long or chosen a different single to promote.</p><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-video is-provider-youtube wp-block-embed-youtube wp-embed-aspect-16-9 wp-has-aspect-ratio" id=emb-3><p></p></figure><p id=par-6_75>And it seems as if fans might just get their wish. As the one-year anniversary of evermore is fast approaching, it wouldn’t be unreasonable for Swift to give fans an evermore themed surprise. This is especially true since the “happiness” singer has a birthday coming up and enjoys gifting fans on her special day. Another thing that may get Swift to promote evermore is that it was just Grammy-nominated for album of the year.</p><h2 id=h-the-cowboy-like-me-singer-celebrates-yet-another-album-of-the-year-nomination-with-champagne-problems>The ‘cowboy like me’ singer celebrates yet another album of the year nomination with ‘champagne problems’</h2><p id=par-7_55>“NO PROBLEMS TODAY JUST CHAMPAGNE🥂,” Swift caption a video of her singing “champagne problems”. “I wanted to share this video with you from when&nbsp;@aarondessner&nbsp;and I were doing our fittings for the video and there was a piano, so ofc this happened. SO stoked evermore has been honored like this. Congrats to all our fellow nominees!!”</p><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-rich is-provider-twitter wp-block-embed-twitter" id=emb-4><p lang=en dir=ltr>NO PROBLEMS TODAY JUST CHAMPAGNE?

Some are hoping for a new music video from the singer. Others hope that evermore gets the same treatment that folklore did and Swift performs it in a film. “Release evermore long pond sessions to celebrate (please),” one fan penned. “I really hope she’s dropping a Long Pond evermore special on her birthday,” another shared.</p><p id=par-11_49>Only time will tell if Swift decides to do more promotion for evermore. Certainly, she seems to have the support of fans should she choose to do so. And we can’t deny that the timing for promoting the album couldn’t be more perfect. After all, “’tis the damn season”.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7pLTEmqusoJWawW%2BvzqZmnqakmr%2B1rcinpJ6mpGTBosXLqKlmq6ees7V5xZqlrGWWnruiuMuyZJ6ulae6sL7EZqerp52kwaq7zWaZnp%2BXnruoesetpKVn</p><h4><i class="fas fa-share-alt" aria-hidden=true></i>&nbsp;Share!</h4><ul class=share-buttons><li><a href="https://www.facebook.com/sharer/sharer.php?u=%2ftaylor-swift-fans-finally-evermore-promotion-begging-html.html" target=_blank title="Share on Facebook"><i class="fab fa-facebook" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Share on Facebook</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="https://twitter.com/intent/tweet?source=%2ftaylor-swift-fans-finally-evermore-promotion-begging-html.html" target=_blank title=Tweet><i class="fab fa-twitter" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Tweet</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="https://plus.google.com/share?url=%2ftaylor-swift-fans-finally-evermore-promotion-begging-html.html" target=_blank title="Share on Google+"><i class="fab fa-google-plus" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Share on Google+</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="http://www.tumblr.com/share?v=3&u=%2ftaylor-swift-fans-finally-evermore-promotion-begging-html.html" target=_blank title="Post to Tumblr"><i class="fab fa-tumblr" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Post to Tumblr</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="http://pinterest.com/pin/create/button/?url=%2ftaylor-swift-fans-finally-evermore-promotion-begging-html.html" target=_blank title="Pin it"><i class="fab fa-pinterest-p" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Pin it</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="http://www.reddit.com/submit?url=%2ftaylor-swift-fans-finally-evermore-promotion-begging-html.html" target=_blank title="Submit to Reddit"><i class="fab fa-reddit-alien" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Submit to Reddit</span></a></li></ul><style>ul.share-buttons{list-style:none;padding:0}ul.share-buttons li{display:inline}ul.share-buttons .sr-only{position:absolute;clip:rect(1px 1px 1px 1px);clip:rect(1px,1px,1px,1px);padding:0;border:0;height:1px;width:1px;overflow:hidden}</style><div class="prev-next-post pure-g"><div class=pure-u-1-24 style=text-align:left><a href=./these-violent-delights-book-review-jazz-age-ya.html><i class="fa fa-chevron-left"></i></a></div><div class=pure-u-10-24><nav class=prev><a href=./these-violent-delights-book-review-jazz-age-ya.html>These Violent Delights book review: Jazz Age YA retelling of Romeo and Juliet is mesmeri</a></nav></div><div class=pure-u-2-24>&nbsp;</div><div class=pure-u-10-24><nav class=next><a href=./interview-darrell-miller-fox-rothschild-llp.html>Interview: Darrell Miller, Fox Rothschild LLP</a></nav></div><div class=pure-u-1-24 style=text-align:right><a href=./interview-darrell-miller-fox-rothschild-llp.html><i class="fa fa-chevron-right"></i></a></div></div></div></div></div><script src=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/blackburn/js/ui.js></script>
