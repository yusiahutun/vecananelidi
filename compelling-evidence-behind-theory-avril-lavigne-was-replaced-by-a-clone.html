<time>16 May 2024, 00:00</time></div></div><p><strong>He’s just a boy and Avril’s just a girl – can she make it any more obvious? Well, apparently to some fans she can. They believe singer-songwriter Avril Lavigne was replaced by a clone after dying a long time ago. The wild conspiracy theory that the Avril we know today isn’t the same that rocked onto the scene with her debut album as a teenager hasn’t disappeared. So, let’s find out what it’s all about – and what Canadian herself had to say about it.</strong></p><p>The conspiracy theory that Avril Lavigne is not a human, and is, in fact, a clone, is edgier than her second album. The <a href=#>music</a> star first erupted onto the charts with her first record, Let Go. It was hailed as the biggest debut in pop of 2002, and went 7-times Platinum. It sold more than 16 million copies worldwide and peaked at number two on the US Billboard charts. Not only that, but it was a huge success for the teenager at the time from Belleville, Ontario. The Greater Napanee native was launched into the <a href=#>celebrity</a> sphere early, a vast difference from her small town roots, growing up in a town with only 15,000 people. Since then, fans have been obsessed she’s a clone – so where did the Avril Lavigne conspiracy begin?</p><figure class="wp-block-grvmedia-grv-video GRVMultiVideo"></figure><h2 class=wp-block-heading id=h-avril-lavigne-conspiracy-has-been-around-a-long-time>Avril Lavigne conspiracy has been around a long time</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/cdn1.celebritytidbit.com/uploads/39/2023/09/GettyImages-2290366-685x1024.jpg><p>Cast your minds back to 2011, or even further to 2005. A Brazilian blog, named Avril Esta Morta (Avril is Dead), posted a story claiming the star had died in 2011. But other fans believe they heard rumors even before that, back in 2005. Although, there’s no more details about what it was or if there was a paper trail.</p><p>The conspiracy claims Avril Lavigne died, alleging fame and a family death affected the star after her debut album.</p><p>It goes on to suggest a doppelgänger called Melissa was hired to distract the paparazzi who would always be on her tail. Then, as the body double grew close to the singer, was eventually taught how to perform and act like the star. She was so convincing the record company buried reports Avril herself had died and instead hired Melissa to become her – the theory claims.</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading id=h-the-evidence-that-people-obsess-over>The ‘evidence’ that people obsess over</h2><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-video is-provider-youtube wp-block-embed-youtube wp-embed-aspect-16-9 wp-has-aspect-ratio"><p></p></figure><p>Now, there’s no truth or hard evidence to this wild Avril Lavigne conspiracy. The theory is just that – a theory. Avril is clearly alive and well.</p><p>However, the ‘clues’ that some fans can’t seem to get out of their heads revolves around how the star looks. Followers believe the appearance and disappearance of certain moles and skin blemishes over time is proof this clone took over Avril Lavigne’s life. Another take, is that the name Melissa was penned on the singer’s hand during one photoshoot as a sign.</p><p>Although at first look, it may seem believable, but blemishes and moles can come and go with makeup and small cosmetic procedures. A quick watch at <a href=#>TV</a>‘s Dr Pimple Popper and any Google search will come back with striking before and after close-ups.</p><p><a href=#>YouTube</a> creators love spooky stories and jumped on the strange tale, like the one above. But remember, with no hard evidence, they’re re-telling the same strange conspiracy story.</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading id=h-hidden-meanings-behind-lyrics>Hidden meanings behind lyrics</h2><p>Others dived into Avril’s lyrics to find answers. They claim there were hidden messages in her songs, My Happy ending, Together and The Best Years of Our Lives from her second album, Under My Skin. The record came out in 2004, so this would have been just before the whispers of the Avril Lavigne clone conspiracy. But it’d also be eight years prior to the bombshell blog post with the allegations.</p><p>In Together, lyrics include ‘something just isn’t right’ and ‘I’m living a lie’, as well as ‘this has gone on so long’. Looking at the Best Years of our Lives, which Avril collaborated with Evan Taubenfeld for, there’s more. Evan and Avril are close friends, but rumors claim they were an item. Evan was her lead guitarist and was part of her band when her fame skyrocketed in 2022. However, he left the band two years later and signed a record deal himself in a bid to pursue his own music career. But the lyrics from their song could be seen as Evan missing the ‘real’ Avril – which fans think means more than what meets the eye.</p><p>Some avenues of the theory suggest Melissa recorded the album and song with Evan. Later, ‘feeling guilty’ over taking part. Others claim they used pre-existing recordings with the real Lavigne to make up the tracks of her second album.</p><p>Despite all of this, some listeners have fun with it.</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading id=h-how-avril-lavigne-really-feels-about-the-conspiracy-theory-and-her-clone>How Avril Lavigne really feels about the conspiracy theory and her ‘clone’</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/cdn1.celebritytidbit.com/uploads/39/2023/09/GettyImages-1389446163-755x1024.jpg><p>The songwriter was first asked about the wild claims in 2014 on Brazilian TV show Panico na Band. It was the first time Avril heard about the wild Lavigne theory, and she simply said: “Well, I’m here”.</p><p>In 2015, BuzzFeed <a href=# rel=nofollow>reporter</a> Ryan Broderick tweeted about the blog and it went viral. After, the post admits the theory is a hoax and added a line. It said: “This blog was created to show how conspiracy theories can look true.” The original creator later apologized and changed the post to state the singer never died.</p><p>Three years later, during a Facebook live stream, a fan asked whether she was dead – strange. But the star brushed it off and replied: “No, I’m not dead. I’m here.”</p><p>Again, she further clarified: “People are just bored and need something to talk about”.</p><p>A year later, she was quizzed again with Australia’s KIIS 106.5, with Kyle and Jackie O. Avril Lavgine called the entire ordeal “weird” and couldn’t believe fans thought she had been replaced with a clone. However, the radio hosts played into the wild story by saying she “never” denied the rumors.</p><p>That wasn’t the end of it, either. It seems Avril gets asked about this quite regularly, but she still doesn’t seem to phased by it. In 2019, she <a href=# rel=nofollow>told</a> Entertainment Weekly it was a “dumb internet rumor”. Then in 2022, <a href=# rel=nofollow>speaking</a> with Galore Magazine, she said it was “random” and that “it’s been brought up to me for like, years”.</p><p>Related Topics</p><p>MORE CELEBRITY STORIES</p><span></span><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7pLHLnpmroaSuwaqwwaKrZ5ufonxzfJFsZmlxX2eEcK%2FOpqeepJyeu6h5xK%2BgnZ2emLJursShoKecXam1prvRsmSarqKeuW64wK%2BgoKaVYsSiv4yrnKmkkZiypXnBsmSaZZOhvK%2Bxjg%3D%3D</p><h4><i class="fas fa-share-alt" aria-hidden=true></i>&nbsp;Share!</h4><ul class=share-buttons><li><a href="https://www.facebook.com/sharer/sharer.php?u=%2fcompelling-evidence-behind-theory-avril-lavigne-was-replaced-by-a-clone.html" target=_blank title="Share on Facebook"><i class="fab fa-facebook" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Share on Facebook</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="https://twitter.com/intent/tweet?source=%2fcompelling-evidence-behind-theory-avril-lavigne-was-replaced-by-a-clone.html" target=_blank title=Tweet><i class="fab fa-twitter" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Tweet</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="https://plus.google.com/share?url=%2fcompelling-evidence-behind-theory-avril-lavigne-was-replaced-by-a-clone.html" target=_blank title="Share on Google+"><i class="fab fa-google-plus" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Share on Google+</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="http://www.tumblr.com/share?v=3&u=%2fcompelling-evidence-behind-theory-avril-lavigne-was-replaced-by-a-clone.html" target=_blank title="Post to Tumblr"><i class="fab fa-tumblr" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Post to Tumblr</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="http://pinterest.com/pin/create/button/?url=%2fcompelling-evidence-behind-theory-avril-lavigne-was-replaced-by-a-clone.html" target=_blank title="Pin it"><i class="fab fa-pinterest-p" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Pin it</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="http://www.reddit.com/submit?url=%2fcompelling-evidence-behind-theory-avril-lavigne-was-replaced-by-a-clone.html" target=_blank title="Submit to Reddit"><i class="fab fa-reddit-alien" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Submit to Reddit</span></a></li></ul><style>ul.share-buttons{list-style:none;padding:0}ul.share-buttons li{display:inline}ul.share-buttons .sr-only{position:absolute;clip:rect(1px 1px 1px 1px);clip:rect(1px,1px,1px,1px);padding:0;border:0;height:1px;width:1px;overflow:hidden}</style><div class="prev-next-post pure-g"><div class=pure-u-1-24 style=text-align:left><a href=./giada-de-laurentiis-fresh-pasta-recipe-1-favorites-nice-tender-html.html><i class="fa fa-chevron-left"></i></a></div><div class=pure-u-10-24><nav class=prev><a href=./giada-de-laurentiis-fresh-pasta-recipe-1-favorites-nice-tender-html.html>Giada De Laurentiis' Fresh Pasta Recipe Is 1 of Her Favorites: 'It's Nice and Tender'</a></nav></div><div class=pure-u-2-24>&nbsp;</div><div class=pure-u-10-24><nav class=next><a href=./13-surprising-facts-about-ray-luzier.html>13 Surprising Facts About Ray Luzier</a></nav></div><div class=pure-u-1-24 style=text-align:right><a href=./13-surprising-facts-about-ray-luzier.html><i class="fa fa-chevron-right"></i></a></div></div></div></div></div><script src=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/blackburn/js/ui.js></script>
