However, while major components (like the motherboard, CPU cooler, RAM, and GPU) received cosmetic upgrades following this trend, the PSU, with its tangled mess of cables, remained a brutalist eyesore at the bottom of the case.</p><p>To alleviate this visual discrepancy, case manufacturers started incorporating dedicated covers for the PSU, which soon became a favored accessory among aesthetically-minded consumers. But what exactly is the purpose of a PSU shroud? Should you consider using one?</p><h2 id=what-is-a-psu-shroud>What Is a PSU Shroud?</h2><p>A PSU shroud is a cover or enclosure designed to conceal the power supply unit and other unsightly accessories (HDD cage, Fan hub, etc.) within a PC case. It is usually positioned at the bottom of a case, separating the <a href=#>PSU and its accompanying cables</a> from the other components.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>The primary objective of a PSU shroud is to improve the overall appearance of a custom build, especially when using a windowed PC case and a non-modular/semi-modular power supply. Given how crucial cable management is for achieving a clean and organized setup and for in-case airflow, this accessory has also been equipped with cutaways to route the PSU cables into the main section of the case.</p><p>Initially, PSU shrouds were regarded as DIY projects, with several enthusiasts crafting unique concealments by utilizing a wide variety of materials. Some builders fashioned custom shrouds from fiberglass, plexiglass, or even aluminum, whereas others resorted to 3D printing for designing colored polymer covers.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Consequently, manufacturers recognized this emerging trend and included PSU shrouds in almost every PC case that shipped with a transparent side panel. Nowadays, you no longer need to rely on DIY solutions as <a href=#>budget PC cases</a> often arrive with built-in shrouds, elevating the visual appeal of your custom build.</p><h2 id=3-advantages-of-using-a-psu-shroud>3 Advantages of Using a PSU Shroud</h2><p>While integrating a PSU shroud doesn't directly affect your PC's performance, functionality, or cooling potential, it offers multiple advantages in terms of cable management and overall customization. Let's look at some of the key features associated with installing a PSU shroud.</p><li><strong>Improves Cable Management:</strong> As mentioned earlier, one of the major benefits of using a dedicated PSU shroud is its ability to streamline cable management in a PC case. By neatly tucking away the PSU and its cables, this concealment minimizes additional clutter while facilitating easier maintenance and upgrades.</li><li><strong>Reduces Dust Accumulation:</strong> Dust accumulation inside a PC case hinders optimal airflow, which can lead to overheating issues. In this regard, a PSU shroud acts as a protective barrier, reducing the likelihood of dust settling on the power supply unit and other components (HDD, SSDs, and so on).</li><li><strong>Additional Expansion Options:</strong> Owing to their adjustable, modular design, PSU shrouds provide additional mounting slots (at the top) for 2.5-inch SATA SSDs and can support up to a maximum of three 120mm or two 140mm case fans. Case manufacturers like Lian Li and Fractal Design also include specialized mounting points for 240mm/360mm water cooling radiators and pump/reservoir combos.</li><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong> <img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static1.makeuseofimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/be-quiet-psu-shroud-in-case.jpg><h2 id=3-factors-to-consider-when-buying-a-custom-psu-shroud>3 Factors to Consider When Buying a Custom PSU Shroud</h2><p>Although we recommend investing in a PC case that incorporates a dedicated PSU cover in its design, it is possible to get your hands on a custom shroud from platforms like Etsy, V1 Tech, and Amazon. Since standalone PSU shrouds are relatively scarce in the current market, consider the following factors when shopping for one.</p><li><strong>Compatibility:</strong> Before purchasing a custom PSU shroud, ensure the accessory is compatible with your PC case. Different cases have varying layouts, and a PSU shroud that fits perfectly in one case may not necessarily fit in another. Check the accessory's dimensions and form factor while verifying that the shroud aligns with the mounting points in your chassis.</li><li><strong>Build Quality:</strong> Custom PSU shrouds are available in a wide range of materials, including acrylic, aluminum, and steel. Acrylic shrouds (also known as plexiglass) are transparent and offer various customization options, while aluminum and steel shrouds provide a durable concealment that complements darker color schemes. As a result, you must choose a design that aligns closely with the overall aesthetic of your PC build.</li><li><strong>Ease of Installation:</strong> Opt for a PSU shroud that can easily be installed without compromising the structural integrity of the case or the power supply unit. Look for options that prioritize tool-less installation and don't require additional modifications to your chassis. Proprietary PSU shrouds from reputable manufacturers like Corsair and Be Quiet! can be purchased from the respective websites.</li><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=aesthetics-over-functionality>Aesthetics Over Functionality</h2><p>In a nutshell, PSU shrouds hold significant value for enthusiasts eager to showcase their customized rigs. PSU shrouds provide a worthwhile solution for concealing unattractive components that may not harmonize with the overall aesthetic of a PC build.</p><p>If you prefer a minimalist and tidy setup with cables neatly hidden away, opting for a windowed PC case with a dedicated PSU shroud should be a no-brainer. However, if cable management isn't a priority, you might consider investing in a modular PSU that minimizes any additional clutter through its detachable cables.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7rq3KnqysnZ%2Bbe6S7zGiuoZmkYra0ecBmp6ytXai1s7vUnWY%3D</p><h4><i class="fas fa-share-alt" aria-hidden=true></i>&nbsp;Share!</h4><ul class=share-buttons><li><a href="https://www.facebook.com/sharer/sharer.php?u=%2fwhat-is-a-psu-shroud.html" target=_blank title="Share on Facebook"><i class="fab fa-facebook" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Share on Facebook</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="https://twitter.com/intent/tweet?source=%2fwhat-is-a-psu-shroud.html" target=_blank title=Tweet><i class="fab fa-twitter" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Tweet</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="https://plus.google.com/share?url=%2fwhat-is-a-psu-shroud.html" target=_blank title="Share on Google+"><i class="fab fa-google-plus" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Share on Google+</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="http://www.tumblr.com/share?v=3&u=%2fwhat-is-a-psu-shroud.html" target=_blank title="Post to Tumblr"><i class="fab fa-tumblr" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Post to Tumblr</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="http://pinterest.com/pin/create/button/?url=%2fwhat-is-a-psu-shroud.html" target=_blank title="Pin it"><i class="fab fa-pinterest-p" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Pin it</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="http://www.reddit.com/submit?url=%2fwhat-is-a-psu-shroud.html" target=_blank title="Submit to Reddit"><i class="fab fa-reddit-alien" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Submit to Reddit</span></a></li></ul><style>ul.share-buttons{list-style:none;padding:0}ul.share-buttons li{display:inline}ul.share-buttons .sr-only{position:absolute;clip:rect(1px 1px 1px 1px);clip:rect(1px,1px,1px,1px);padding:0;border:0;height:1px;width:1px;overflow:hidden}</style><div class="prev-next-post pure-g"><div class=pure-u-1-24 style=text-align:left><a href=./489500-what-hug-sleeps-net-worth-2023-post-shark-tank-update.html><i class="fa fa-chevron-left"></i></a></div><div class=pure-u-10-24><nav class=prev><a href=./489500-what-hug-sleeps-net-worth-2023-post-shark-tank-update.html>What is Hug Sleep's net worth in 2023: Post-Shark Tank update</a></nav></div><div class=pure-u-2-24>&nbsp;</div><div class=pure-u-10-24><nav class=next><a href=./old-dominion-bar-nashville-odies.html>Old Dominion Opening Nashville Bar &amp;amp; Music Venue, Odie's</a></nav></div><div class=pure-u-1-24 style=text-align:right><a href=./old-dominion-bar-nashville-odies.html><i class="fa fa-chevron-right"></i></a></div></div></div></div></div><script src=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/blackburn/js/ui.js></script>
