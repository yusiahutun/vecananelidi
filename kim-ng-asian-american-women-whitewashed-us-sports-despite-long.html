At a time when Donald Trump supporters gladly accept his rhetoric on the coronavirus as made in China, Ng’s rise to the top may serve to finally afford recognition to the Asian-American women who have helped to shape US sports.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">“Having a women GM and that too an Asian-American is important to jot down. There is a long history of Asians in the US being considered as foreign and never American enough,” said Thangaraj, who wrote the book Desi Hoop Dreams: pickup basketball and the making of Asian-American Masculinity.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">“This is an incredible statement. The hiring of Kim Ng is to really claim the ways in which Asian-Americans have a much longer history in the US and with intimate ties to the national pastime and intimate ties to the nation.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/cdn.i-scmp.com/sites/default/files/d8/images/methode/2020/11/27/509250f0-286c-11eb-bf26-f2b76f37a526_1320x770_152717.jpg><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">“This becomes so much more important when we think about Donald Trump’s constant classifying of the coronavirus as the Chinese virus or the ‘kung flu’.”</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">The 52-year-old Ng was last week appointed the first female GM in Major League Baseball, having been identified as a rising star two decades ago but knocked back for similar positions by six franchises.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">In her first interview since her appointment, Ng alluded to the time it took for her to finally become a GM, having previously risen to New York Yankees assistant general manager at the age of 29 before joining the Los Angeles Dodgers as vice-president and assistant general manager.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/cdn.i-scmp.com/sites/default/files/d8/images/methode/2020/11/27/a445cf9a-287d-11eb-bf26-f2b76f37a526_1320x770_152717.jpeg><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">Scott Bush, chief executive officer for the Society of American Baseball Research, said he hoped Ng’s new status would inspire more women to consider a career in baseball.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">“It’s a massive step forward for the entire baseball industry,” said Bush. “For quite some time, Kim Ng epitomised the glass ceiling in Major League Baseball; she has been qualified to be a general manager for two decades now.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">“Hopefully her hiring will encourage more women and girls to pursue careers in baseball, and lead to a more diverse and equitable composition of MLB front offices.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/cdn.i-scmp.com/sites/default/files/d8/images/methode/2020/11/27/640a5e0c-286c-11eb-bf26-f2b76f37a526_1320x770_152717.jpg><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">“Of course, all of the above can also be said of Ng’s representation of people of Asian descent. In addition to a lack of gender diversity, MLB has long suffered from a lack of racial diversity. Ng has been an inspiration to many who aspire to work in MLB and the baseball industry in general, and her new position will no doubt inspire even more. A banner day for baseball.”</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">Thangaraj said the rise of Kamala Harris as the first black and South Asian vice-president – when President-elect Joe Biden takes office on January 20 – was significant to the American psyche and highlights the growing movement of Asian-Americans and other minorities and how they are challenging the racial restructuring of the country and its sporting landscape.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">“We cannot by any means talk about this without talking about the ways in which Black Lives Matter, which has become multiracial, has been pivotal to this movement and the hiring of Kim Ng,” said Thangaraj.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">“In this sense, we can’t forget that there is a much longer active engagement of Chinese-Americans in US sport. But that history has long been forgotten or refused a space.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">“Helen Wong, because of various restrictions put on Chinese in Chinatown, did not have the same type of mobility and access to sporting fame as that of white women during that time.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">“The Mei Wahs changed the way in which women’s participation in basketball was thought. They changed the nature of the women’s game.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">“When Asian women are celebrated, it is rarely ever in a national sport, and this is part of the whitewashing of sport that when you have stories of success, it is told through African-American and not Asian, as if they didn’t exist. Kim’s story is the story of the long history of Asians in the US and Asian-American life.”</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">Ng’s appointment, while long overdue, is only a small step on the road to ensuring women are given equal respect in a white male-dominated arena, said Thangaraj.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">In an ideal world, Ng’s hiring would be as normal as any male candidate who possessed similar experience and qualifications. Thangaraj hopes that would indeed be the case in the future. For now, he said women – even in Ng’s case – are disadvantaged by the fact that they need men to legitimise their worth.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">“What it shows is the ways in which national sports have been so connected to men and performing masculinity,” said Thangaraj. “There has been a refusal to really celebrate and admit women into those ranks. It has been much tougher for women and especially Asian-American women to enter those realms as coaches, administrators and GMs, working at the highest levels of sport.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">“We assume sport becomes the ultimate arbitrator of merit. The language of sport, you talk about success based on this notion of merit.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">“Here it is very clear that racism and sexism drive professional sports. Even though [Kim Ng] has been so high qualified, she has not had the same opportunities to be GM and has been passed over numerous times.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">“If you see articles coming out, they are all talking about her hiring, all point to men saying she is great. This showcases the idea that it is the realm of men who can validate her own merit, instead of her merit being seen for what it is – her hard work, her brilliance, her strategies, her incredible knowledge of the game and the business.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">“When we talk about Kim Ng, it’s also very important that we pay attention to the people who have not been able to make it and how they are fighting every day to get a job within Asian America.</p><p>This article appeared in the South China Morning Post print edition as: Asian-American women ‘whitewashed’ amid Kim Ng’s rise to the top</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tK%2FMqWWcp51kwLG70a1mqKyYmr9uv8%2Boqa1nkafBqq%2FLnmZsaWFlgHSAjqSgpmWenHqiv8iapWaZnZq%2Fqq%2FAp2Swp52au27Dx6Krnq%2BRqLWmsIyuqmaroKS%2Ftb%2BMnZysqJmpsm64zqee</p><h4><i class="fas fa-share-alt" aria-hidden=true></i>&nbsp;Share!</h4><ul class=share-buttons><li><a href="https://www.facebook.com/sharer/sharer.php?u=%2fkim-ng-asian-american-women-whitewashed-us-sports-despite-long.html" target=_blank title="Share on Facebook"><i class="fab fa-facebook" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Share on Facebook</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="https://twitter.com/intent/tweet?source=%2fkim-ng-asian-american-women-whitewashed-us-sports-despite-long.html" target=_blank title=Tweet><i class="fab fa-twitter" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Tweet</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="https://plus.google.com/share?url=%2fkim-ng-asian-american-women-whitewashed-us-sports-despite-long.html" target=_blank title="Share on Google+"><i class="fab fa-google-plus" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Share on Google+</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="http://www.tumblr.com/share?v=3&u=%2fkim-ng-asian-american-women-whitewashed-us-sports-despite-long.html" target=_blank title="Post to Tumblr"><i class="fab fa-tumblr" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Post to Tumblr</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="http://pinterest.com/pin/create/button/?url=%2fkim-ng-asian-american-women-whitewashed-us-sports-despite-long.html" target=_blank title="Pin it"><i class="fab fa-pinterest-p" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Pin it</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="http://www.reddit.com/submit?url=%2fkim-ng-asian-american-women-whitewashed-us-sports-despite-long.html" target=_blank title="Submit to Reddit"><i class="fab fa-reddit-alien" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Submit to Reddit</span></a></li></ul><style>ul.share-buttons{list-style:none;padding:0}ul.share-buttons li{display:inline}ul.share-buttons .sr-only{position:absolute;clip:rect(1px 1px 1px 1px);clip:rect(1px,1px,1px,1px);padding:0;border:0;height:1px;width:1px;overflow:hidden}</style><div class="prev-next-post pure-g"><div class=pure-u-1-24 style=text-align:left><a href=./best-halo-hair-extensions.html><i class="fa fa-chevron-left"></i></a></div><div class=pure-u-10-24><nav class=prev><a href=./best-halo-hair-extensions.html>The Best Halo Hair Extensions on Amazon</a></nav></div><div class=pure-u-2-24>&nbsp;</div><div class=pure-u-10-24><nav class=next><a href=./how-checking-pulse-finger-detect-risk-heart-disease-html.html>How checking your pulse through your FINGER could detect risk of heart disease</a></nav></div><div class=pure-u-1-24 style=text-align:right><a href=./how-checking-pulse-finger-detect-risk-heart-disease-html.html><i class="fa fa-chevron-right"></i></a></div></div></div></div></div><script src=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/blackburn/js/ui.js></script>
