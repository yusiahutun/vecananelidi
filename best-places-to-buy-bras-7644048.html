Not only is shopping notoriously tedious and frustrating but also online shopping adds extra riskiness — especially when it comes to bras. What if the underwire becomes uncomfortable? Could there be issues with the cups gaping? Is it possible that the promised invisibleness of a seamless demi bra beneath T-shirts might not hold true?</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-1 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">That’s why spending your time on quality and expert-backed brands is so important. And we’ve made it easier for you to do so. Opt for any labels on this list — whether it be Skims and their uber-soft bralettes or Soma’s meticulous craftsmanship and attentive sizing — and you’ll find that you’ll be more confident in your new bra and less concerned with return policies. (Though, truthfully, many of these on the list have pretty good ones, like Fleur Du Mal’s free shipping on any order, anytime.)&nbsp;</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-2 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">But functionality and wearability aside, a great bra can greatly boost confidence. “Wearing great quality underwear or lingerie sets boost our self-esteem, even if no one sees it,” Morgan Lanyon, founder and creative director of lingerie Label SILQUE, tells InStyle. That’s why, when choosing which brands to include, we carefully considered shapes, sizing, and — of course — how cute of a selection each brand offers. Below, find lacey bralettes, sultry plunges, and smooth T-shirt bras, ranging from accessible prices ($) to more splurge-worthy ($$$) to see.<br></p><span class=heading-toc id=toc-skims></span> <img width=1500 height=1000 data-sizes=750px alt="Skims Ultimate Teardrop Push-Up Bra" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center src="https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.instyle.com/thmb/_x5NFuGBWLfyCcLQ7OzmSrFX3zA=/fit-in/1500x1000/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc()/skims-ultimate-teardrop-push-up-bra-2665ab8f756a40c6b2a1b19608b57c71.jpg"> <span class=figure-article-caption-owner><p>Skims</p></span><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-1 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">Now a word synonymous with <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=internalLink data-ordinal=1>shapewear </a>and intimates, Skims, the label founded by <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=internalLink data-ordinal=2>Kim Kardashian</a>, has solidified its top spot in the lingerie market, challenging long-standing competitors with innovative designs and celebrity-backed appeal. ICYMI, everyone from <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=internalLink data-ordinal=3>Brooke Shields</a> to Ice Spice and <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=internalLink data-ordinal=4>Heidi Klum</a> has starred in Skims campaigns. But not only is the brand celeb-approved, but it has also gained rave reviews from almost everyone; fashion editors will praise their inclusive size range, while your best friend probably won’t stop talking about <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=internalLink data-ordinal=5>the brand’s uber-soft slip dress</a>. And while boasting an extensive range of more than twenty collections, including swimwear, loungewear, and traditional shapewear, their bras are equally impressive— if not where the brand shines. Each bra comes in sizes 30A-46H and in plenty of different silhouettes, from plunging scoop bras to seamless demis, molded balconettes, and strapless bandeaus — in lace, mesh, and buttery-soft fabrics. Plus, each comes in an impressive span of true skin-tone sades and exciting colors, from poppy pinks to neon roses.&nbsp;</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-2 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html"><strong>Shipping Policy: </strong>Free shipping over $75, 30-day returns |<strong> Best for: </strong>Shade range | <strong>Size Range: </strong>30A-46H</p><span class=heading-toc id=toc-thirdlove></span> <img width=1500 height=1000 data-sizes=750px alt="Thirdlove Form 360 Fit Wireless Bra " style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center src="https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.instyle.com/thmb/I18MyCqzuEXgRDe0mRji-_u_jpM=/fit-in/1500x1000/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc()/thirdlove-form-360-fit-wireless-bra-aecff94276d144fba075eaed9d969d24.jpg"> <span class=figure-article-caption-owner><p>Thirdlove</p></span><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-4 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">Searching for versatile bras offering excellent coverage and support? Look no further than ThirdLove. Since 2013, the brand has dedicated itself to improving the online shopping experience — one that is, ahem, hard to begin without factoring in improperly fitted and wrongly sized bras — making your lingerie splurge a no-frills affair. You might think that’s an impossible feat; we’d agree if it weren’t for ThirdLove’s array of styles and sizes, available in half-cups, “fit finder” quizzes, virtual styling appointments, and inclusive product images (The brand also includes a fuller range of sizing, from 30AA to an L cup, which would be remiss not to mention). The size-inclusive label carries over 20 styles, <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=internalLink data-ordinal=1>including InStyle editor favorite:</a> Their 24/7 Classic T-Shirt Bra. It’s a classic everyday bra that encompasses the brand’s mission as a whole, which is the creation of an undergarment that doesn’t skimp on comfort. And when we say they’re comfy, we mean comfy. Whether you choose a second-skin-like unlined bra, opt for fuller coverage, or go for a sexier plunge, you’ll find a bra with a great fit to grant you the comfort to wear confidently throughout your day.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-5 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html"><strong>Shipping Policy: </strong>Free shipping over $100, 60-day returns |<strong> Best for: </strong>Size range | <strong>Size Range: </strong>30AA-44E</p><span class=heading-toc id=toc-nordstrom></span> <img width=1500 height=1000 data-sizes=750px alt="Nordstrom All Day Comfort Bralette " style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center src="https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.instyle.com/thmb/lXb0jly1KlLvH2muWfN2OGo_fI8=/fit-in/1500x1000/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc()/Nordstrom-All-Day-Comfort-Bralette-e1bac419991c467e9c7a7642090837cc.jpg"> <span class=figure-article-caption-owner><p>Nordstrom</p></span><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-7 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">Perhaps you rely on Nordstrom for your cocktail attire, wedding guest dresses, and work pants — but don’t overlook their lingerie department, which is full of brands like Natori (a favorite of lingerie-expert of <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=externalLink data-ordinal=1 rel=nocaes>Corra Harrington’s</a>), Wacoal, SKIMS, Honeylove, Free People, and others. The department store provides a wide range of bra options and fun lingerie essentials. So, whether you’re looking to invest in a longline bra for everyday wear or something a little more daring, like a sultry teddy or chemises, Nordstrom provides a tremendous multi-retailer selection of everything from shapewear to hosiery. They even have a large selection of nipple covers and pasties. Still, if you’re searching for a classic bra from a reliable brand, Nordstrom has you covered — literally. Scroll through over pages of unique colors and patterns, including iridescent triangle bras, ultra-comfy convertibles, razorback sports bras, and halters, ranging in price from just $11 to around $800 (Versace bra-tops and Jean Paul Gaultier corsets, anyone?), fit for a wearer shopping for just about anything.&nbsp;</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-8 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html"><strong>Shipping Policy: </strong>Free shipping, 30-day returns |<strong> Best for: </strong>Multi-brand selection | <strong>Size Range: </strong>Various</p><span class=heading-toc id=toc-bare-necessities></span><p><h3><span class=product-record__heading--text>Bare Necessities</span></h3></p><img width=1500 height=933 data-sizes=750px alt="Bare Necessities WonderWire Front-Close Bra " style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center src="https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.instyle.com/thmb/01L1HLs9uZV6k16sEtte3a-9sfU=/fit-in/1500x933/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc()/Bare-Necessities-WonderWire-Front-Close-Bra-e3fe870b16124a5a987a812cc4d63988.jpg"> <span class=figure-article-caption-owner><p>Bare Necessities</p></span><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-11 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">Bare Necessities is a multi-brand retailer with a large selection of bras, panties, swimwear, loungewear — and almost every other lingerie necessity. And we mean nearly every other essential: There are 50+ subtypes of styles to choose from; think panties organized by high-cut briefs and thongs, activewear sorted by DD+ sports bras, and plus-size activewear. It’s an all-encompassing, inclusive retailer, especially within its bra options—shop pages of front-closure bras, push-up bras, and plus-size bras. We especially love that there’s a healthy assortment of DD+ designs (we’re talking over 700 styles) and their <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=externalLink data-ordinal=1 rel="sponsored nofollow noskim">Bra Finder</a>, an online quiz to accurately access your needs on the site, to make your bra shopping journey just a tad easier. And with how frustrating bra shopping can get, we appreciate how functional the quiz is for shoppers. If the selection comes and turns out not to be for you, the brand charges a fee for shipping on returns, but it’s per package, not per item, so if you need to return multiple items, you only pay once. They also frequently have sales that are usually 20-30% off some subset of bras.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-12 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html"><strong>Shipping Policy: </strong>Free shipping over $70, 21-day returns |<strong> Best for: </strong>DD+ options | <strong>Size Range: </strong>30AA-46O</p><span class=heading-toc id=toc-journelle></span> <img width=1500 height=1000 data-sizes=750px alt="Journelle " style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center src="https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.instyle.com/thmb/j1AfPlNd_FXIOqQUwSLtNfCCrgQ=/fit-in/1500x1000/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc()/Journelle-3721f4e36a4e46d88c630bb14dc3c7f4.jpg"> <span class=figure-article-caption-owner><p>Journelle</p></span><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-14 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">As another luxury and high-end lingerie curation, Journelle is an all-in-one destination for sleepwear, undergarments, and other essentials. The brand carries plenty of familiar and beloved designers —Chantelle, Cosabella, Simone Perele, to name a few — along with their self-titled label full of pretty underthings, which is equipped with <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=externalLink data-ordinal=1 rel="sponsored nofollow noskim">embellished plunge bras </a>and <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=externalLink data-ordinal=2 rel="sponsored nofollow noskim">other luxe, lacey moments.</a> Explore their website to discover ethereal choices, such as statement bras perfect for a subtle allure beneath a silk blouse on a night out, or rummage through their versatile seamless designs in strapless and t-shirt styles. There’s also a healthy variety of bra types, from demi to wireless to underwire. Plus, they even offer solution-wear, like adhesive, convertible, and stick-on bras. You can find a curation of maternity bras, too — whether pumping or nursing, each bra is customizable to comfort — and post-surgical mastectomy alternatives, ensuring a bra for everybody’s needs.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-15 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html"><strong>Shipping Policy: </strong>Free shipping over $200, 14-day returns |<strong> Best for: </strong>Lingerie essentials | <strong>Size Range: </strong>Various</p><span class=heading-toc id=toc-intimissimi></span><p><h3><span class=product-record__heading--text>Intimissimi</span></h3></p><img width=1500 height=1000 data-sizes=750px alt="Intissimi Giada Microfiber Bandeau Bra" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center src="https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.instyle.com/thmb/0S24YHvdOXntY6fsTE224YJqawg=/fit-in/1500x1000/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc()/intissimi-giada-microfiber-bandeau-bra-f9a8ffd97b124fff8bf9d0f101632915.jpg"> <span class=figure-article-caption-owner><p>Intissimi</p></span><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-17 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">In the pursuit of stylish support, Intimissimi delivers. Known for their slinky silks and underthings adorned with boudoir-inspired lace, each piece from the brand offers an elevated twist on lingerie drawer must-haves. Shop their not-so-basic basics and find exciting details to their lightly padded bras, like ruffled underbands, delicate netting, and sleek satin straps, showing their intentional design. And the raving doesn’t stop there. Though their bras are so beautiful, it certainly could (of course, only if you’re guilty of indulging in a not-so-practical bra purely for its aesthetics). Yet, the brand seamlessly blends glamorousness with functionality. Whether mesh-lined or seamless, each bra provides natural support by shaping and moving with the body. There are no slipping strapless bras or underwires that uncomfortably dig in — once again proving their practical design. So, if you’re looking to invest in a piece that serves elegance with unparalleled comfort, Intimissimi is your ultimate destination. Most options are relatively affordable, too, running you for as low as $39 for a bra.&nbsp;</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-18 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html"><strong>Shipping Policy: </strong>Free shipping over $75, 14-day returns |<strong> Best for: </strong>Affordable lingerie | <strong>Size Range: </strong>B-DDD</p><span class=heading-toc id=toc-cosabella></span> <img width=1500 height=1000 data-sizes=750px alt=Cosabella style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center src="https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.instyle.com/thmb/ifsHc_Vmrh6mCVnnMYnygqWTPdw=/fit-in/1500x1000/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc()/Cosabella-9240c628eb7b4a609c81b94876f26223.jpg"> <span class=figure-article-caption-owner><p>Cosabella</p></span><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-20 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">Known for its contemporary, stylish, and comfortable designs since 1983, Cosabella is a tried-and-true brand full of high-quality materials, luxurious laces, and sensual underthings. Their products include everything from bras, patines, bodysuits, sleepwear, and loungewear, boasting a full variety of options when you need to refresh your top drawer or step up your lingerie game. In pursuit of finding the perfect bra size, Cosabella features a function on their website where you can shop by fit, band size, and cup size. Standard sizing ranges from A-D cups and starts at a 28 band (difficult sometimes to find, FYI!), extended is designed to fit those with larger frames, and curvy is designed to fit those with a small frame and a full bust. We appreciate how functional the site is because despite how many designs they carry — from intricate and super-soft bralettes to structured and molded bras — it’s a no-frills shopping experience to find the ideal shape and fit on their site.&nbsp;</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-21 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html"><strong>Shipping Policy: </strong>Free shipping over $75, 30-day returns |<strong> Best for: </strong>Everyday bras | <strong>Size Range: </strong>28A-40H</p><span class=heading-toc id=toc-cuup></span> <img width=1500 height=1000 data-sizes=750px alt=CUUP style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center src="https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.instyle.com/thmb/F0ydtSPYcp6a7kDX4u_heZuApTo=/fit-in/1500x1000/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc()/CUUP-af9a44f968a646a18deff8f9cec69de6.jpg"> <span class=figure-article-caption-owner><p>CUUP</p></span><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-23 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">Chances are, you’ve seen specialty lingerie store CUUP’s translucent bras on your Instagram feed. The brand’s minimalist styles and modern colorways seem all over the place, but if they’re everywhere except your own closet, here’s what you should know before buying: Each bra is wireless and supportive — a mix that doesn’t happen nearly as much as it should in the lingerie world. They’re also a label that creates ultra-comfortable bras ideal for everyday wear. Since their construction includes a smooth edge over the bust, if you’re wearing a tightly fitted T-shirt, the edges won’t appear, even in their mesh designs. So, not only are they invisible, they’re uber-comfortable and stylish. The brand also boasts an impressive size range, with options from 30A-38H and super cute thongs, briefs, and bikinis to match your bra pick. Whether you’re feeling an earthy jewel tone or a gunmetal grey, each bra comes with a matching panty in the same colorway, making for the ideal one-stop shop for a cute bra and undie set.&nbsp;</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-24 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html"><strong>Shipping Policy: </strong>Free shipping over $75, 30-day returns |<strong> Best for: </strong>Comfort | <strong>Size Range: </strong>30A-38H</p><span class=heading-toc id=toc-dora-larsen></span><p><h3><span class=product-record__heading--text>Dora Larsen</span></h3></p><img width=1500 height=1000 data-sizes=750px alt="Dora Larsen Dorothee Lace High Apex Underwire Bra" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center src="https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.instyle.com/thmb/tsTy-XADc3Rf2lmd_92d4Lzm5sY=/fit-in/1500x1000/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc()/Dorothee-Lace-High-Apex-Underwire-Bra-cbc3adb55d914bd5a1f8145a86e871fb.jpg"> <span class=figure-article-caption-owner><p>Dora Larsen</p></span><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-27 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">This candy-colored brand, founded by ex-lingerie buyer Georgia Larsen, is known for its playful color palette — one that is as intentional as it seems. Seafoam greens matched with sugar blues, indigos married with passionfruit pink, the colors of these bras feel purposeful because they are; Larsen intertwined her fashion background with her love for surrealist paintings to create colorways like these. Each bra is as cheerful as it is whimsical, carefully curated with bespoke shades according to color theory. If you’ve ever felt discouraged during lingerie shopping because that one color combo doesn’t come in your size or your preferred style (... or if you’re used to getting lost in a sea of beige, like me), Dora Larsen is for you. No matter the design, whether it be a lacey triangle or embroidered bralette, a sheer underwire, or a cotton t-shirt bra, each shape is available in the same colorways as the others. No more discovering that vibrant bra only comes in a size that is not yours. Other notable elements make these stapes feel special, such as the intentional elements like pops of eyelash lace or mesh. Still, what we really love is that each delicate design is consciously constructed with eco-friendly and recycled materials, meaning every bra not only feels good on you but also does good for the environment.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-28 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html"><strong>Shipping Policy: </strong>Free express shipping over $150, 28-day returns |<strong> Best for: </strong>Colorful Sets | <strong>Size Range: </strong>32A-32F</p><span class=heading-toc id=toc-pepper></span> <img width=1500 height=1000 data-sizes=750px alt="Pepper Classic All You Bra" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center src="https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.instyle.com/thmb/xLCpYMP-QhSpFxXv0bHjbKk0CH4=/fit-in/1500x1000/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc()/pepper-classic-all-you-bra-37897f86bff64e2eb387230fe948ee45.jpg"> <span class=figure-article-caption-owner><p>Pepper</p></span><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-30 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">CEOs and Co-Founders of Pepper, Jaclyn Fu and Lia Winograd, noticed gaps within bras — push-ups with a noticeable space between the fabric and your skin, not-so-quite fitting t-shirt bras — and gaps within the whole lingerie industry altogether: There were no bra companies focused exclusively on small chested people. So, with the mission of trying to eliminate the body shame associated with having a small bust and inspired by Co-Founder Jaclyn’s personal experience of not being able to find a properly fitting 32A bra, Pepper was born. Since most brands use 36C as their model, scaling down in design will not get an ideal fit. Instead, Pepper uses small chests as the design inspiration and caters to those sizes. All Pepper bras are thoughtfully designed to fit and flatter AA, A, and B cup sizes. And, put plain and simple, they do — with each intentionally made with cups with a shallower depth to scoop and lift breasts of that size to solve that pesky gaping issue. The brand also offers a healthy assortment of bands, featuring AA cups with bands in the 30s and 42s.&nbsp;</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-31 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html"><strong>Shipping Policy: </strong>Free shipping over $125, 30-day returns |<strong> Best for: </strong>Small-busted options | <strong>Size Range: </strong>30AA-42B</p><span class=heading-toc id=toc-fleur-du-mal></span><p><h3><span class=product-record__heading--text>Fleur du Mal</span></h3></p><img width=1500 height=1000 data-sizes=750px alt="Fleur Du Mal Lily Embroidery Plunge Demi Bra" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center src="https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.instyle.com/thmb/MRbBDVZyOYNbCh8gKMRB1xB5EsE=/fit-in/1500x1000/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc()/FleurDuMal-f9d54aa27d454dd389c619e93cb43fc9.jpg"> <span class=figure-article-caption-owner><p>Fleur du Mal</p></span><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-33 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">Perhaps you appreciate lingerie with whimsical and playful designs – whether it's fruit-inspired, rose-and-thorn printed, or maybe you prefer a seamless jersey-fabric T-shirt bra.

If that's the case, you're in luck because Fleur Du Mal caters to all types of bra-wearers, offering everything from everyday basics to special occasion favorites. You'll discover a range that includes satin triangle bras, classic lace demis, ultra-soft t-shirt bras, and undergarments that remain inconspicuous even beneath the sheerest of shirts.

Not only does Fleur Du Mal present an impressive array of high-quality silk robes, slips, bodysuits, and exquisitely designed sets featuring vibrant colors, but their bra collection also caters to a wide variety of shapes and sizes.

But, while so many sizes are not standardized across all brands, Lanyon tells InStyle to expect sizing inconsistencies when bra shopping.“Whilst a tape measure can tell you the right size in terms of numbers, the only way to truly know if something fits is to try it on and then look out for a few key signs that indicate you're in a good-fitting bra,” says Lanyon. Pay attention to the band — that should sit straight across your torso and where you should be able to get two fingers under with little resistance. Also, check the straps, which, according to Lanyon, should sit “comfortably on your shoulders without any tightness or sliding.” And finally, the cups should be smooth against the curve of your breast with no gaps.</p><span class=heading-toc id=toc-your-questions-answered></span><h2 id=mntl-sc-block_3-0-5 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-heading--instyle commerce-sc-block-heading--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-heading mntl-sc-block-heading"><span class=mntl-sc-block-heading__text>Your Questions, Answered</span></h2><h3 id=mntl-sc-block_3-0-6 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-subheading--instyle commerce-sc-block-subheading--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-subheading mntl-sc-block-subheading"><span class=mntl-sc-block-subheading__text>How do you find your bra size?</span></h3><p id=mntl-sc-block_3-0-7 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">“No matter which styles or colors you gravitate towards, the most important thing to look for is fit,” Fu tells InStyle. “Most people don’t know their true bra size, so the first thing to do is measure yourself. A well-fitting bra should hug your chest (zero gaps!), straps should stay put, and it should feel snug on the loosest hook.” Many bra brands offer comprehensive fit guides on their website, detailing how your bra should fit. The typical rule of thumb for finding band size is, while using measuring tape, measure around the ribcage, just beneath the bust. For cup size, measure around the fullest part of your bust.</p><h3 id=mntl-sc-block_3-0-8 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-subheading--instyle commerce-sc-block-subheading--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-subheading mntl-sc-block-subheading"><span class=mntl-sc-block-subheading__text>Can you return bras after trying them?</span></h3><p id=mntl-sc-block_3-0-9 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">Whether or not you can return a bra after trying them depends on the company’s return policy.
