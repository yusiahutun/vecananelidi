Nan, who emigrated from South Korea, has inspired Joanna to be passionate in her own endeavors.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-6 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">In a 2021 appearance on <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=externalLink data-ordinal=1>The Hoda Show</a>, Joanna <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=internalLink data-ordinal=2>attributed her success</a> to her mother, saying she was inspired by “how much she fought for the family.”</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-8 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">“Through the lens of all that she’s been through — the hardship, the fight — I think, for her, I think for both of us, it’s that thing of like, Mom, you set me up well,” she told host <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=internalLink data-ordinal=1>Hoda Kotb</a>. “You set me up well because of the way you fought for this, your passion, now I get to kind of live in that wake.”</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-10 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">Here’s everything there is to know about Joanna Gaines’ parents, Jerry and Nan Stevens.</p><span class=heading-toc id=toc-they-have-been-married-for-more-than-50-years></span><h2 id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-12 class="comp mntl-sc-block people-sc-block-heading mntl-sc-block-heading"><span class=mntl-sc-block-heading__text>They have been married for more than 50 years</span></h2><figure id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-13 class="comp mntl-sc-block-image--no-theme mntl-sc-block-image mntl-sc-block people-sc-block-image mntl-sc-block-universal-image figure-square figure-high-res"><span class=figure-article-caption-text>Joanna Gaines' Parents, Jerry and Nan Stevens.</span> <span class=figure-article-caption-owner><p>Joanna Gaines Instagram</p></span></figure><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-14 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">Joanna’s parents met in 1969. In a 2017 <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=externalLink data-ordinal=1>Instagram</a> post celebrating their 45th anniversary, Joanna wrote, “My parents met in 1969 when my dad was stationed in Korea and their story is one you hear about in the movies. All the odds were against them but they fought through.”</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-16 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">In her book, The Magnolia Story, Joanna wrote that Jerry and Nan met at a party in Seoul, South Korea. Nan spotted Jerry sitting by himself and told a friend, “That’s the man I’m going to marry.”</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-18 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">In 2022, Nan appeared on Joanna’s podcast, <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=externalLink data-ordinal=1 rel=nofollow>The Stories We Tell with Joanna Gaines</a>, and the pair discussed how she <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=internalLink data-ordinal=2>met her future husband</a>. “You guys were at a party,” Joanna said, and her mom was coy about the details. “Oh, who cares, everybody knows,” Joanna continued. “She likes the Beatles — it was a pot party. It’s fine.”</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-20 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">Nan recalled that she and Jerry started spending time together after the party, until he had to leave the country. Two weeks before his departure, he told her, “I think I’m in love with you.” Jerry moved back to the U.S. and the two kept up a long-distance relationship.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-22 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">Eventually, Jerry sent her a plane ticket and asked her to marry him. Even though their families didn’t initially approve, they got married in San Francisco during the summer of 1972.</p><span class=heading-toc id=toc-they-had-a-rocky-start></span><h2 id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-24 class="comp mntl-sc-block people-sc-block-heading mntl-sc-block-heading"><span class=mntl-sc-block-heading__text>They had a rocky start</span></h2><figure id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-25 class="comp mntl-sc-block-image--no-theme mntl-sc-block-image mntl-sc-block people-sc-block-image mntl-sc-block-universal-image figure-square figure-high-res"><span class=figure-article-caption-text>Joanna Gaines' Parents, Jerry and Nan Stevens.</span> <span class=figure-article-caption-owner><p>Joanna Gaines Instagram</p></span></figure><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-26 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">While their initial meeting and love story sound like something out of a movie, it wasn’t always easy for Jerry and Nan. In The Magnolia Story, Joanna was candid about how much her parents fought at the beginning of their relationship.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-28 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">“There were times, they say, when they didn’t think they would make it because all they did was fight,” Joanna wrote.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-30 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">She later asked her mom about this time on The Stories We Tell. “The first year was rough because Dad was into drugs,” Joanna said, which Nan confirmed. Jerry told her they were “broke” and the pair dealt with backlash from their families.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-32 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">However, after Jerry’s mother died, he began to view life differently, and things got better for the couple. “He envisioned himself in a casket, with his family surrounding him, and it hit him just how wrongly he was living his life,” Joanna wrote in The Magnolia Story. “He knew he didn’t want to end up in that casket the way he envisioned, leaving my mom alone to fend for herself.”<br></p><span class=heading-toc id=toc-nan-is-from-south-korea></span><h2 id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-34 class="comp mntl-sc-block people-sc-block-heading mntl-sc-block-heading"><span class=mntl-sc-block-heading__text>Nan is from South Korea</span></h2><figure id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-35 class="comp mntl-sc-block-image--no-theme mntl-sc-block-image mntl-sc-block people-sc-block-image mntl-sc-block-universal-image figure-portrait figure-high-res"><span class=figure-article-caption-text>Joanna Gaines and her mother, Nan Stevens.</span> <span class=figure-article-caption-owner><p>Joanna Gaines Instagram</p></span></figure><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-36 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">Jerry and Nan met in South Korea, where Nan was born and raised. In 2023, Joanna, her husband <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=internalLink data-ordinal=1>Chip Gaines</a> and their family <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=internalLink data-ordinal=2>traveled to South Korea</a> to visit the place where her mom lived and learn more about their heritage.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-38 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">“For years, my mother has talked about taking her three daughters to Seoul, Korea when the cherry blossoms are in full bloom,” Joanna wrote in <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=externalLink data-ordinal=1>an Instagram post</a>. “And for years, that’s all it was — a dream we’d talk about in that ‘maybe, someday’ way we all do when something feels just a little out of reach. But this year, we decided to finally book it, and we convinced 24 members of our family to come with us to visit the place where my mom grew up.”</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-40 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">In 2020, Joanna opened up about her background and how it inspired her children’s book The World Needs Who You Were Made to Be. “<a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=internalLink data-ordinal=1>My Korean heritage</a> is one of the things I’m most proud of,” she said in a press release. “The culture is just so beautiful.”<br></p><span class=heading-toc id=toc-chip-and-joanna-met-at-jerrys-shop></span><h2 id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-42 class="comp mntl-sc-block people-sc-block-heading mntl-sc-block-heading"><span class=mntl-sc-block-heading__text>Chip and Joanna met at Jerry’s shop</span></h2><figure id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-43 class="comp mntl-sc-block-image--no-theme mntl-sc-block-image mntl-sc-block people-sc-block-image mntl-sc-block-universal-image figure-square figure-high-res"><span class=figure-article-caption-text>Joanna Gaines and her father, Jerry Stevens.</span> <span class=figure-article-caption-owner><p>Joanna Gaines Instagram</p></span></figure><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-44 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">Jerry and Nan eventually moved to Waco, Texas, and Jerry opened a tire shop. Joanna worked in the office, where she eventually ended up meeting Chip.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-46 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">Chip had actually seen her photo before they met. “Her dad made the mistake of putting a picture of the family behind the counter at his shop,” he told <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=externalLink data-ordinal=1>PopSugar</a> in 2018. “I knew I’d marry her one day just by the picture on the wall.”</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-48 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">The pair later met when Chip came in to get his brakes fixed. “We met in the waiting area and hit it off immediately.

And not fully embracing the most beautiful thing about myself, which was you,” she said.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-56 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">Joanna recalled the time she visited New York City’s Koreatown during college. “I didn’t fully own who I was until that moment,” she said. “That I am this culture, this Korean history, this Korean story, my Korean mother, my Korean grandmother. That’s the richest part of who I am. And walking in the fullness of that really changed the narrative for me.”</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-58 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">Nan held onto her heritage by displaying Korean furniture and mementos in Joanna's childhood home in Rose Hill, Kansas.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-60 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">"The formal living room was the room I was drawn to," Joanna said during an interview on the Ideas of Order&nbsp;podcast in January 2024. “Now I understand what it was and the meaning of that room for her.&nbsp;What my mom was trying to do was <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=internalLink data-ordinal=1>feel known and seen in this one space</a>."<br></p><span class=heading-toc id=toc-joanna-is-always-learning-from-them></span><h2 id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-62 class="comp mntl-sc-block people-sc-block-heading mntl-sc-block-heading"><span class=mntl-sc-block-heading__text>Joanna is always learning from them</span></h2><figure id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-63 class="comp mntl-sc-block-image--no-theme mntl-sc-block-image mntl-sc-block people-sc-block-image mntl-sc-block-universal-image figure-square figure-high-res"><span class=figure-article-caption-text>Joanna Gaines' Parents, Jerry and Nan Stevens.</span> <span class=figure-article-caption-owner><p>Joanna Gaines Instagram</p></span></figure><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-64 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">Joanna is always taking in important lessons from her parents, as they are two people she looks up to. In a 2021 issue of <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=externalLink data-ordinal=1 rel=nofollow>Magnolia Journal</a>, she told a meaningful story about her dad.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-66 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">She recalled that a year and a half prior, her dad had asked her to stay and watch the sunset with him before their family went home. She was focused on getting her kids home and in bed, so she said no.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-68 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">“It didn’t take me long to regret that moment,” she wrote. “My dad is the most understanding person when it comes to my family time. An invitation to stay and watch the sun disappear with him was a special request. I realized I’d held a meaningful moment hostage in the name of efficiency.”</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-70 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">Even though she wanted to reschedule their sunset date, she couldn’t — as the COVID-19 pandemic began soon after. Eventually, she and Jerry watched the sunset in his backyard while socially distanced, and she called the experience a “turning point” in her life.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-72 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">“No longer would I measure my life based on what I achieved in a week, a day or an hour,” she wrote. “Now, it is time spent in moments like the one I shared with my dad that I hope define my lifetime. Time spent abandoning plans in order to catch a glimpse of something truly beautiful. … Time spent taking in the only view that really matters: the one unfolding right in front of me.”<br></p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmiolaS9rbGNnKamZ5GhuW6twaisrWWapK6vusBmnpqhnprAbrzAq5ynrKNit6a%2B0bJkp5meYsC1sdWepaxlZ2uBdIKTcA%3D%3D</p><h4><i class="fas fa-share-alt" aria-hidden=true></i>&nbsp;Share!</h4><ul class=share-buttons><li><a href="https://www.facebook.com/sharer/sharer.php?u=%2fall-about-joanna-gaines-parents-jerry-nan-stevens-7643647.html" target=_blank title="Share on Facebook"><i class="fab fa-facebook" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Share on Facebook</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="https://twitter.com/intent/tweet?source=%2fall-about-joanna-gaines-parents-jerry-nan-stevens-7643647.html" target=_blank title=Tweet><i class="fab fa-twitter" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Tweet</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="https://plus.google.com/share?url=%2fall-about-joanna-gaines-parents-jerry-nan-stevens-7643647.html" target=_blank title="Share on Google+"><i class="fab fa-google-plus" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Share on Google+</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="http://www.tumblr.com/share?v=3&u=%2fall-about-joanna-gaines-parents-jerry-nan-stevens-7643647.html" target=_blank title="Post to Tumblr"><i class="fab fa-tumblr" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Post to Tumblr</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="http://pinterest.com/pin/create/button/?url=%2fall-about-joanna-gaines-parents-jerry-nan-stevens-7643647.html" target=_blank title="Pin it"><i class="fab fa-pinterest-p" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Pin it</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="http://www.reddit.com/submit?url=%2fall-about-joanna-gaines-parents-jerry-nan-stevens-7643647.html" target=_blank title="Submit to Reddit"><i class="fab fa-reddit-alien" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Submit to Reddit</span></a></li></ul><style>ul.share-buttons{list-style:none;padding:0}ul.share-buttons li{display:inline}ul.share-buttons .sr-only{position:absolute;clip:rect(1px 1px 1px 1px);clip:rect(1px,1px,1px,1px);padding:0;border:0;height:1px;width:1px;overflow:hidden}</style><div class="prev-next-post pure-g"><div class=pure-u-1-24 style=text-align:left><a href=./jeremy-ayala.html><i class="fa fa-chevron-left"></i></a></div><div class=pure-u-10-24><nav class=prev><a href=./jeremy-ayala.html>Jeremy Ayala</a></nav></div><div class=pure-u-2-24>&nbsp;</div><div class=pure-u-10-24><nav class=next><a href=./14-facts-about-custard-apples.html>14 Facts About Custard Apples</a></nav></div><div class=pure-u-1-24 style=text-align:right><a href=./14-facts-about-custard-apples.html><i class="fa fa-chevron-right"></i></a></div></div></div></div></div><script src=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/blackburn/js/ui.js></script>
