Throughout those centuries, a few things have remained consistent about vampires: They have fangs, they can’t go out in the sun, they are immortal, they need to be invited into houses, they can fly, they are generally driven by a thirst for human blood. But one must not forget perhaps the most important trait of vampires: They are very, very hot.</p><p class=clay-paragraph data-editable=text data-uri=www.vulture.com/_components/clay-paragraph/instances/ckv6zd1zn000p3e6k218c6xx2@published data-word-count=95>Admittedly, this is a mostly modern trait. The vampire has evolved since the advent of film and TV in the 20th century, breaking some of the aforementioned rules in favor of being hotter onscreen. The vampires of The Twilight Saga avoid the sun not because it causes them to perish but because it makes their skin glitter; the vampires in The Vampire Diaries universe can consume food and beverages along with regular-degular blood. We don’t really care about the noncanonical behavior, because they are all — and I can’t say this enough — extremely hot.</p><p class=clay-paragraph data-editable=text data-uri=www.vulture.com/_components/clay-paragraph/instances/ckv6zd23o000q3e6k9xug8y73@published data-word-count=156>With another spooky season upon us, I have been asked to do the unthinkable: rank the hot vampires from movies and television by their hotness. I can’t really explain the methodology behind this heavily curated ranking of hot vampires that gave me several migraines, except to say that every vampire on this list had to be a vampire and had to be hot. Of course, hotness includes not just looks, but personality, style, and, perhaps most importantly, hair. I started with a list of almost 100 vampires from movies and TV shows and eliminated as I saw fit, cutting some human characters who only became vampires late in their stories (Elena Gilbert of The Vampire Diaries, Bella Swan of The Twilight Saga), the boring vampires (Elena Gilbert, Bella Swan), and Tom Cruise from Interview with the Vampire. I favored unexpected choices because while you’re reading a blog about hot people, you may as well learn something.</p><h2 class=clay-subheader_fancy data-editable=text data-uri=www.vulture.com/_components/clay-subheader/instances/ckv6zu4to001p3e6kaxgptsbj@published><span class=fancy-divider></span> <span class=text>35.

Brad Pitt is hot in the Anne Rice adaptation Interview with the Vampire, with his long, healthy hair, billowing old-timey blouses, and signature pouty lips. But Brad Pitt did the least with this role when he should have been doing the most, so it’s not as hot as it could have been. He was also Baby Brad here, and Baby Brad is not as good as rugged, moody, middle-aged Brad. Can I get a time machine so I can go back to 1994 and give this man more confidence? I can’t believe I’m saying this.</p><h2 class=clay-subheader_fancy data-editable=text data-uri=www.vulture.com/_components/clay-subheader/instances/ckv75xmp7002v3e6ky6zlqo4h@published><span class=fancy-divider></span> <span class=text>34.

Viktor is not hot when he is first awakened from hibernation (he looks like me in the morning), but once he gets some blood in him and slips into a long tailored coat with shoulder pads and an embellished collar, he looks more fabulous than several of the vampires on this list and many who did not make the cut.</p><h2 class=clay-subheader_fancy data-editable=text data-uri=www.vulture.com/_components/clay-subheader/instances/ckv764l0f006i3e6kur35um5q@published><span class=fancy-divider></span> <span class=text>29.

And it was on the WB, so it was filled with hotties. Spike was a bad boy turned good one. As a human, he was a (unsuccessful) romantic poet, which is kind of hot even though it’s annoying. Then he became a vicious vampire and then a ’90s heartthrob guaranteed to make anyone weak in the knees, but especially Buffy herself and teenagers in 1999.</p><h2 class=clay-subheader_fancy data-editable=text data-uri=www.vulture.com/_components/clay-subheader/instances/ckv769a37008n3e6k410ty4iq@published><span class=fancy-divider></span> <span class=text>22.

Lee Pace is only briefly in Breaking Dawn: Part 2, but his impact is as astonishing as his height, which is six-foot-five, in case you didn’t know. Garrett’s styling is, for lack of a better word, interesting. It embodies early 2000s emo, so he’d probably make it pretty big on TikTok today. Although this towering ruby-eyed vamp was born in New England amid the American Revolutionary War and, according to the <a href=#>Twilight Saga Wiki</a>, was a “true believer in the American Dream,” he absolutely has My Chemical Romance’s entire discography memorized. Unlike most vampires in The Twilight Saga, Garrett does not have a special talent (other than being tall), so I have a soft spot for him.</p><h2 class=clay-subheader_fancy data-editable=text data-uri=www.vulture.com/_components/clay-subheader/instances/ckv769wfv008y3e6k3qszyr9l@published><span class=fancy-divider></span> <span class=text>21.

Stefan Salvatore, the broody romantic lead on the CW’s long-running vampire show, which aired from 2009–17, has thick, luscious hair (a must for any vampire), moody eyebrows, and a romantic attitude that is sweet but occasionally overwhelming. There’s also that thing he has where he loves to sacrifice himself and also the thing where turns into a ripper, which means that he cuts apart the bodies of the people he kills and puts them back together, because even during a vampiric rampage, he feels kind of guilty.

And even after becoming a vampire, her maker, Bill Compton (who sadly did not make the list because it’s competitive), forces her to live conservatively to prevent her from becoming an impulsive monster. Nonetheless, throughout the series, Jessica grows in her confidence and gets progressively hotter. And Jessica isn’t like most vampires. In lieu of a dark wardrobe of mostly leather, she goes for sundresses, ideal for the Louisiana heat, that accentuate her shiny red (the color of blood) hair.</p><h2 class=clay-subheader_fancy data-editable=text data-uri=www.vulture.com/_components/clay-subheader/instances/ckv76crc7009v3e6k8bv81qoi@published><span class=fancy-divider></span> <span class=text>18.

But I am not dumb enough to voluntarily attend high school as an immortal in my second century of life, which is exactly what Edward Cullen does.

Absolutely not. But Laszlo, who visits libraries (hot) for the pornography, almost has me convinced that it is.</p><h2 class=clay-subheader_fancy data-editable=text data-uri=www.vulture.com/_components/clay-subheader/instances/ckv76pywv00cb3e6klc99cwlo@published><span class=fancy-divider></span> <span class=text>9.

Did you know that Damon Salvatore’s favorite book is Call of the Wild? Damon, in his leather-jacket-fitted-tee-glass-of-whiskey uniform is a handful, and can be very annoying (I’m annoyed now thinking about how annoying he is), but he’s still hot because he pretends he’s not sad, and also because of the leather jackets. If your eyes are looking for a nice little snack, peep the actors who played Damon and Stefan Salvatore (Ian Somerhalder and Paul Wesley, respectively) on the <a href=#>Brother’s Bond Bourbon Instagram feed</a>. But please do not do this unless you’re prepared to become a pile of goo. And when that happens, you cannot blame me, professional sexy vampire ranker, because I warned you.</p><h2 class=clay-subheader_fancy data-editable=text data-uri=www.vulture.com/_components/clay-subheader/instances/ckv76scyo00cx3e6k8y3ibfdu@published><span class=fancy-divider></span> <span class=text>7.

Basically, he’s killed a lot of people. But in the ’90s and early 2000s, Angel devoted his heretofore cursed life to atoning up for his loathsome ways. He also wears the spiked boy-band-hair look well and is always in a reliably tailored coat, and at this point you know that, according to me, excellent hair and outerwear advance a vampire’s hotness by many levels.</p><h2 class=clay-subheader_fancy data-editable=text data-uri=www.vulture.com/_components/clay-subheader/instances/ckv76tcke00d83e6ksca8oojp@published><span class=fancy-divider></span> <span class=text>5. & 6.

Here they play centuries-old vampires who have been lovers for centuries and who, like the best of the best, habitually walk around in sunglasses. Adam, an internationally famous musician, is in crisis. Centuries of existence have made him depressed about the state of the world, and he’s questioning the point of his immortality. When Eve comes to visit, they spend their nights on the streets of Detroit, listening to music and playing chess. While Adam (Hiddleston) dresses in classic dark vampire style, black hair and everything, Eve has the opposite aesthetic, white-blonde across the board. This movie is so sexy and haunting that my body aches and I must move on to the next vampire before I explode.</p><h2 class=clay-subheader_fancy data-editable=text data-uri=www.vulture.com/_components/clay-subheader/instances/ckv76x11s00dj3e6ku3s1l2xt@published><span class=fancy-divider></span> <span class=text>4.

Elijah Mikaelson (Daniel Gillies), The Vampire Diaries/The Originals</span></h2><p class=clay-paragraph data-editable=text data-uri=www.vulture.com/_components/clay-paragraph/instances/ckv7jeri000qd3e6kfto526iu@published data-word-count=154>I know what you’re probably thinking: Carrie, you just wrote that this is not a list of every single character from The Vampire Diaries. It’s not, but that’s almost what it is. In fairness to me, the hottest vampires from The Vampire Diaries are played by some of the hottest people who have ever lived, so they deserve our time and respect. In normal life, we do not like to see a man in a suit rip hearts out of bodies with ease. But when Elijah Mikaelson pulls this signature move, we very much like to see it, especially if blood gets in his hair, which is as delicious to me as my blood is to him. Elijah has a soft spot for the underdog, a quality that absolutely factors into hotness, and he is the star of the <a href=#>hottest GIF of all time</a>, which you know intimately if you had a Tumblr phase.</p><h2 class=clay-subheader_fancy data-editable=text data-uri=www.vulture.com/_components/clay-subheader/instances/ckv770wv900e53e6k1m8hv213@published><span class=fancy-divider></span> <span class=text>2. Eric Northman (Alexander Skarsgård), True Blood</span></h2><p class=clay-paragraph data-editable=text data-uri=www.vulture.com/_components/clay-paragraph/instances/ckv7jfjv600qp3e6kfmi1h7rh@published data-word-count=131>Eric Northman is a former viking and committed small-business owner covered in blood 70 percent of the time, with sweet eyes like Baby Grogu and an obsession with his own hair. Remember when he freaked out because there was <a href=#>blood in his hair</a> while his highlights were processing? Eric’s fascination with his own hair is completely justified, because Alexander Skarsgård has one of the best heads in Hollywood. Like all the other hottest onscreen vampires, Eric has an appreciation for outerwear, including leather jackets, tracksuits, and bombers, despite the fact that he lives in Louisiana, where it is hot and humid all the time. Next to Vampire Diaries, True Blood is the most-referenced vampire project on this list, proof that TV vamps are hotter than film vamps. That actually is science.</p><h2 class=clay-subheader_fancy data-editable=text data-uri=www.vulture.com/_components/clay-subheader/instances/ckv772d7j00eg3e6kf5k5osvv@published><span class=fancy-divider></span> <span class=text>1. Katherine Pierce (Nina Dobrev), The Vampire Diaries</span></h2><p class=clay-paragraph data-editable=text data-uri=www.vulture.com/_components/clay-paragraph/instances/ckv7jhkz000r13e6k2v1zxhvu@published data-word-count=235>Style icon. Master manipulator. A real fucking bitch. Katherine Pierce, the diabolical doppelgänger of Elena Gilbert, is the hottest vampire of all time, both onscreen and off. In the Vampire Diaries universe, doppelgängers look exactly alike and are portrayed by the same actors, and thus Katherine Pierce is played by Nina Dobrev, just as Elena Gilbert is played by Nina Dobrev. No offense to Elena and her skinny jeans and riding boots and straight hair and henleys: Katherine is just hotter. Every single thing Katherine — a 500-plus-year-old vampire from Bulgaria who is pure evil — does is the sexiest thing you’ll ever see. She is hot while drinking blood bags, drinking people until they die, killing people for no reason, torturing the Salvatore brothers and every other man who has ever loved her, and <a href=#>drunk dancing</a> to Lykke Li with a lamp while being held prisoner in a loft apartment. Choosing the hottest vampire for this list was not easy: I spent a week staring at a wall trying to decide, but when I came to the conclusion that it could be Katherine Pierce, I stopped thinking about it, because I knew it was the only choice that was correct. It is also quite fitting, because in the end, this turned out to be a ranking of characters from The Vampire Diaries universe with a bunch of other vampires from other things sprinkled in.</p><h2>More From This Series</h2><ul class=package-list-items><li class=package-list-item data-track-type=article-link data-track-component-name=package-list data-track-page-uri=www.vulture.com/_pages/ckvctrppv000laona4kfiufr4@published data-track-headline="Vampire Veek Will Never Die" data-track-index=0 data-track-component-title><span class=svg-wrapper></span><a class=package-list-item-link href=#><span class=headline>Vampire Veek Will Never Die</span></a></li><li class=package-list-item data-track-type=article-link data-track-component-name=package-list data-track-page-uri=www.vulture.com/_pages/ckvcsxb630000smn6vh8sl1st@published data-track-headline="Against Vampires" data-track-index=1 data-track-component-title><span class=svg-wrapper></span><a class=package-list-item-link href=#><span class=headline>Against Vampires</span></a></li><li class=package-list-item data-track-type=article-link data-track-component-name=package-list data-track-page-uri=www.vulture.com/_pages/ckvcr7svb00007bnajhpsyqtv@published data-track-headline="The Greatest Place to Be a Vampire Was New York in the ’90s" data-track-index=2 data-track-component-title><span class=svg-wrapper></span><a class=package-list-item-link href=#><span class=headline>The Greatest Place to Be a Vampire Was New York in the ’90s</span></a></li></ul><a class=see-all-link href=# aria-label="See All from More From This Series"><span class=see-all-link-text>See All</span> <span class=svg-wrapper></span></a><span class=ambrose-short-hed>Vampires, Ranked (by Hotness)</span><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7t8HLrayrnV6YvK57kWlpamdhZXy3rcypoKudo2K%2ForrKnptmmqlitbDAzZ6qrGaYqbqt</p><h4><i class="fas fa-share-alt" aria-hidden=true></i>&nbsp;Share!</h4><ul class=share-buttons><li><a href="https://www.facebook.com/sharer/sharer.php?u=%2fvampires-ranked-by-hotness-html.html" target=_blank title="Share on Facebook"><i class="fab fa-facebook" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Share on Facebook</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="https://twitter.com/intent/tweet?source=%2fvampires-ranked-by-hotness-html.html" target=_blank title=Tweet><i class="fab fa-twitter" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Tweet</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="https://plus.google.com/share?url=%2fvampires-ranked-by-hotness-html.html" target=_blank title="Share on Google+"><i class="fab fa-google-plus" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Share on Google+</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="http://www.tumblr.com/share?v=3&u=%2fvampires-ranked-by-hotness-html.html" target=_blank title="Post to Tumblr"><i class="fab fa-tumblr" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Post to Tumblr</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="http://pinterest.com/pin/create/button/?url=%2fvampires-ranked-by-hotness-html.html" target=_blank title="Pin it"><i class="fab fa-pinterest-p" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Pin it</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="http://www.reddit.com/submit?url=%2fvampires-ranked-by-hotness-html.html" target=_blank title="Submit to Reddit"><i class="fab fa-reddit-alien" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Submit to Reddit</span></a></li></ul><style>ul.share-buttons{list-style:none;padding:0}ul.share-buttons li{display:inline}ul.share-buttons .sr-only{position:absolute;clip:rect(1px 1px 1px 1px);clip:rect(1px,1px,1px,1px);padding:0;border:0;height:1px;width:1px;overflow:hidden}</style><div class="prev-next-post pure-g"><div class=pure-u-1-24 style=text-align:left><a href=./who-is-billy-joels-wife-meet-his-4th-wife-alexis-roderick.html><i class="fa fa-chevron-left"></i></a></div><div class=pure-u-10-24><nav class=prev><a href=./who-is-billy-joels-wife-meet-his-4th-wife-alexis-roderick.html>Who Is Billy Joels Wife?
