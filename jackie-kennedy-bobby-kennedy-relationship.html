I never saw her crying or outwardly morose, but she never had much of an appetite, and the toll of the horror she had survived was plain to see on her painfully thin frame. Family was never far away, and both her sister, Lee, and various Kennedy in-laws visited frequently. Lee had an apartment a few blocks away, as did Bobby and Ethel Kennedy. Jean Kennedy Smith lived within walking distance, too, and her sons, William and Stephen, were favorite playmates of John. Their Irish governess, Bridey Sullivan, quickly became my best friend, and we spent hours chatting together in Central Park while watching the boys.</p><img alt="White, Photograph, People, Standing, Black-and-white, Snapshot, Monochrome, Photography, Monochrome photography, Fun, " title="White, Photograph, People, Standing, Black-and-white, Snapshot, Monochrome, Photography, Monochrome photography, Fun, " width=1024 height=1010 decoding=async data-nimg=1 sizes=100vw src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/hips.hearstapps.com/clv.h-cdn.co/assets/17/19/1494430814-john-ethel-jackie-bobby-kennedy-beach.jpg style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center><a rel=noopener href=# class="pinterest css-1i6sckr e1c1bym14"><img data-dynamic-svg=true src="https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.countryliving.com/_assets/design-tokens/fre/static/icons/social/pinterest.e8cf655.svg?primary=%2523ffffff" data-testid=dynamic-svg-base height=auto width=auto alt=pinterest style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center></a><span class="css-1lk26yx e6iqukd2">Getty Images</span><p>John, Ethel, Jackie, and Robert Kennedy at the beach.</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=6 class="css-x6js8g et3p2gv0">Bobby Kennedy had established residency in New York after stepping down as attorney general to launch his 1964 bid to become the state's Democratic representative in the U.S. Senate. The president's younger brother visited 1040 regularly, usually showing up once a week to have supper with the family. John and Caroline would run and fling themselves at their uncle as soon as he stepped inside the door, clamoring for his attention. Bobby would toss John into the air and catch him, then get down on the floor to play.</p><img alt="Sand, Vacation, Adaptation, Summer, Tree, Beach, Tourism, Recreation, Leisure, Happy, " title="Sand, Vacation, Adaptation, Summer, Tree, Beach, Tourism, Recreation, Leisure, Happy, " width=497 height=549 decoding=async data-nimg=1 sizes=100vw src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/hips.hearstapps.com/clv.h-cdn.co/assets/17/19/1494430234-kathy-john-shannon-hyannis.jpg style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center><a rel=noopener href=# class="pinterest css-1i6sckr e1c1bym14"><img data-dynamic-svg=true src="https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.countryliving.com/_assets/design-tokens/fre/static/icons/social/pinterest.e8cf655.svg?primary=%2523ffffff" data-testid=dynamic-svg-base height=auto width=auto alt=pinterest style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center></a><span class="css-1lk26yx e6iqukd2">Getty Images</span><p>The author with John F.

Very skinny and not broad shouldered like the president had been. The first time he saw me, he had asked my name and flashed a big smile when I told him. "We have a Kathleen in our family, too," he said, referring to his oldest daughter. With eight kids of his own under the age of thirteen, Bobby stepped easily into the role of surrogate father for John and Caroline, and they worshipped him. Madam clearly leaned on him, too. Threatening to tell Uncle Bobby about any misbehavior was like telling the kids Santa Claus was going to find out.</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=12 class="css-x6js8g et3p2gv0">In addition to his Manhattan apartment, which was close to his campaign headquarters in Midtown, Bobby had leased a twenty-five-room hilltop mansion as a weekend retreat in Glen Cove, on the northern shore of Long Island. It was like having a private hotel, with a built-in swimming pool and lovely manicured lawns with plenty of room for the kids to blow off steam with their cousins. Madam liked Glen Cove for all the woodsy trails where she could go horseback riding, and she rented a modest weekend home near Bobby's, a one-level fieldstone house with a stream out back where I showed John how to make paper sailboats to race under a small bridge.</p><img alt="Event, Fun, Ceremony, Drink, Wedding, " title="Event, Fun, Ceremony, Drink, Wedding, " width=646 height=1088 decoding=async data-nimg=1 sizes=100vw src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/hips.hearstapps.com/clv.h-cdn.co/assets/17/19/1494429624-kennedy-family-at-kathy-wedding.jpg style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center><a rel=noopener href=# class="pinterest css-1i6sckr e1c1bym14"><img data-dynamic-svg=true src="https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.countryliving.com/_assets/design-tokens/fre/static/icons/social/pinterest.e8cf655.svg?primary=%2523ffffff" data-testid=dynamic-svg-base height=auto width=auto alt=pinterest style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center></a><span class="css-1lk26yx e6iqukd2">Courtesy of Kathy McKeon</span><p>Jackie, Caroline, and John Kennedy at the author\'s wedding.</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=16 class="dropcap css-1ez97s8 et3p2gv0">It was a great place for the kids to play with all their cousins on the weekend, and Madam enjoyed riding horses there. It was her solitary pursuit. Ethel was that way with sailing, and Joan Kennedy, Ted's wife, had the piano. On the surface, at least, Madam struck me as more like her brother-in-law than her sisters-in-law, though. Bobby and Madam had similar flip sides. Both had magnetic personalities, but then you would come to find out they were actually shy by nature. They were big on being outdoors and loved their sports, especially the ones that called for self-discipline or personal strength. Bobby and Madam were the Kennedys you were most likely to spot swimming farthest out in the ocean, no matter how cold the water was or how strong the tide. They were probably the biggest bookworms, too. Bobby was famous for being able to quote classic verse off the top of his head, and it was Madam who knew the perfect line for him to cite from Romeo and Juliet when Bobby paid tribute to Jack as he accepted the nomination for senator that summer:</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=18 class="css-x6js8g et3p2gv0">"When he shall die,</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=20 class="css-x6js8g et3p2gv0">Take him and cut him out in little stars,</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=22 class="css-x6js8g et3p2gv0">And he shall make the face of heaven so fine</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=24 class="css-x6js8g et3p2gv0">That all the world will be in love with night,</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=26 class="css-x6js8g et3p2gv0">And pay no worship to the garish sun."</p><img alt="Photograph, Standing, Fashion, Vintage clothing, Dress, Snapshot, Black-and-white, Retro style, Event, Monochrome, " title="Photograph, Standing, Fashion, Vintage clothing, Dress, Snapshot, Black-and-white, Retro style, Event, Monochrome, " width=1021 height=1024 decoding=async data-nimg=1 sizes=100vw src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/hips.hearstapps.com/clv.h-cdn.co/assets/17/19/1494430385-jackiekennedy-robertkennedy-dame-margot-fonteyn-dec1962.jpg style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center><a rel=noopener href=# class="pinterest css-1i6sckr e1c1bym14"><img data-dynamic-svg=true src="https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.countryliving.com/_assets/design-tokens/fre/static/icons/social/pinterest.e8cf655.svg?primary=%2523ffffff" data-testid=dynamic-svg-base height=auto width=auto alt=pinterest style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center></a><span class="css-1lk26yx e6iqukd2">Getty Images</span><p>Jackie Kennedy and Bobby Kennedy backstage at an American Ballet Theatre production, 1962.</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=30 class="css-x6js8g et3p2gv0">There was no denying that Madam and her brother-in-law were close. Loss is a terrible love. No matter how much sympathy you have, it's a kind of pain that can only be felt, not imagined. And when it happens in a swift, horrific instant, there is no such thing as healing. Tragedy leaves you with an open wound, not a scar. I never told Madam that I understood these things, or how, but I could see plain as day that this awful shared knowledge was what made the president's widow and younger brother care for each other the way they did.</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=32 class="css-x6js8g et3p2gv0">From <a href=# rel=nofollow data-vars-ga-outbound-link=https://www.amazon.com/dp/1501158945 data-vars-ga-ux-element=Hyperlink data-vars-ga-call-to-action="JACKIE'S GIRL" data-vars-ga-product-id=57495a48-df6c-4828-a7cc-d34cbeefed24 data-vars-ga-link-treatment="sale_t | (not set)" data-href=https://www.amazon.com/dp/1501158945 data-product-url=https://www.amazon.com/dp/1501158945 data-affiliate=true data-affiliate-url=https://www.amazon.com/dp/1501158945 data-affiliate-network='{"id":"f2d19a9b-88b2-4e2b-b0f4-2bcc1aef8ac8","site_id":"f30f2c6f-2363-4b03-b482-ae642b94f911","metadata":{},"network":{"id":"469ce69f-4798-416d-9432-eaa9954b4053","name":"Amazon","metadata":{}}}' data-vars-ga-product-brand="Gallery Books" data-vars-ga-product-price=$18.97 data-vars-ga-product-retailer-id=4da8d1d5-57aa-458d-87e4-330bc0a711d5 data-vars-ga-product-sem3-brand="Gallery Books" data-vars-ga-product-sem3-category=Women data-optimizely-button-poc=_t class="body-link product-links css-a3mbhf ebsw2pb0">JACKIE'S GIRL</a> by Kathy McKeon.
