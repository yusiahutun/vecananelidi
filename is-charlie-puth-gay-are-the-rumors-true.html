<time>03 May 2024, 00:00</time></div></div><p><strong>Rumors about Charlie Puth being gay have been going around in circles for a while now, but is he really gay? Here’s what we know.&nbsp;</strong></p><p>Since his rise to fame, American singer-songwriter Charlie Puth has had his sexuality questioned, and several rumors about him being gay have surfaced. His love life has been quite eventful, and after an interview with 104.3 MYfm, speculations about his sexuality further increased.&nbsp;</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading><span class=ez-toc-section id=Who_Is_Charlie_Puth></span>Who Is Charlie Puth?<span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h2><p>Charlie Puth is an American singer-songwriter, music producer, and director born Charles Otto Puth Jr. on December 2, 1991, in Rumson, New Jersey. His mother, Debra, introduced him to classical music and began teaching him the piano at age four. He created a YouTube channel to upload his songs, and not long after, he caught the attention of&nbsp; <a href=#>The Ellen Show</a> host Ellen Degeneres.&nbsp;</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/gistfest.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/Untitled-Design-83-1024x683.jpg><p>Ellen signed him to her record label Eleveneleven, and it has been up from there for Charlie Puth. He became a well-known singer with his songs and a songwriter for big acts like Maroon 5 and Justin Beiber, to list a few.&nbsp;</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading><span class=ez-toc-section id=Is_Charlie_Puth_Gay></span>Is Charlie Puth Gay?<span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h2><p>Contrary to the widespread speculation that incited this question, the “Lightswitch” singer is not gay. Although there have always been rumors of him being gay, he has always dated female celebrities. There is no evidence of any romantic involvement with a man.&nbsp;</p><p>If the singer has always dated females, it begs the question: why do people think Charlie Puth is gay?&nbsp;</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/gistfest.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/charlie-and-shawn.jpeg><p>Rumors about Charlie Puth being gay can be attributed to fans misconstruing his words and making assumptions based on them. In April 2017, Charlie had an interview with 104.3 MYfm to promote the release of his new single “Attention.” Charlie discussed his friendship with fellow pop star Shawn Mendes during this interview.&nbsp;</p><p>He mentioned that they share pictures of themselves to compare their physique over time. “We’re in a bit of a work-out off a thon. I sent this to Shawn. That was arm day,” he said, showing the interviewer a picture of himself he had sent to Shawn.&nbsp;</p><p>The internet, however, didn’t believe this dynamic and went into a frenzy about Charlie being gay. This speculation trended on Twitter for days, and Charlie and Shawn Mendes have had to clarify this assumption multiple times publicly. Shawn interviewed the same radio station, 104.3 MYfm, later in 2018 to debunk the rumor.&nbsp;</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading><span class=ez-toc-section id=Charlie_Puths_Dating_History></span>Charlie Puth’s Dating History<span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h2><p>Charlie Puth has had quite a romantic journey since his rise to fame. He has been rumored to date a couple of singers and actresses alike. Here’s a quick peek at the list of women he has dated over the years:</p><h3 class=wp-block-heading><span class=ez-toc-section id=Selena_Gomez></span>Selena Gomez<span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h3><p>Charlie and <a href=#>Selena Gomez</a> had a very brief romantic relationship that ended just as quickly as it started in 2016. His smash hit “We Don’t Talk Anymore” was inspired by her! In an interview with Billboard, he mentioned that although short-lived, his relationship with the singer was “very impactful and really messed him up.”&nbsp;</p><h3 class=wp-block-heading><span class=ez-toc-section id=Bella_Thorne></span>Bella Thorne<span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h3><p>Charlie Puth and former Disney star Bella Thorne never confirmed dating, even though the two hung out a couple of times and paparazzi photographed them on a beach together in December 2016.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/gistfest.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/Untitled-Design-84.jpg><p>Things got messy as Charlie stumbled on an outdated article about Bella and her then-ex-boyfriend Tyler. Without adequately reading the article’s date, he thought he had intruded into their relationship and apologized on Twitter.&nbsp;</p><h3 class=wp-block-heading><span class=ez-toc-section id=Danielle_Campbell></span>Danielle Campbell<span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h3><p>Charlie was briefly rumored to be dating “The Originals” star Danielle Campbell in 2017 after he mentioned that he was in a relationship on an episode of the “Ellen Degeneres Show.” The two never publicly denied nor confirmed this.&nbsp;</p><h3 class=wp-block-heading><span class=ez-toc-section id=Halston_Sage></span>Halston Sage<span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h3><p>Charlie had another brief relationship with American actress Halston Sage. The pair had an official Instagram relationship in 2018 and shared some snaps and stories. Both stars have since deleted the posts from their accounts.</p><h3 class=wp-block-heading><span class=ez-toc-section id=Charlotte_Lawrence></span>Charlotte Lawrence<span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h3><p>Charlie and the American singer-songwriter Charlotte Lawrence went public with their relationship on Valentine’s Day in 2019. Their romance was also short-lived, as Charlie confirmed he was single again by September of that same year. His hit single “That’s Hilarious” is rumored to be about her.&nbsp;</p><h3 class=wp-block-heading><span class=ez-toc-section id=Brooke_Sansone></span>Brooke Sansone<span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h3><p>In an interview in December 2022, Charlie revealed that he was dating and in love. In an Instagram post, he revealed the mystery girlfriend was Brooke Sansone, a digital marketer at Butter and Eggs Interiors in N.Y.C., and the two made their red carpet debut in February 2023. They are still together and have been posting happily on social media ever since!&nbsp;</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/gistfest.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/puth-fotor-20230810192144.jpg><h2 class=wp-block-heading><span class=ez-toc-section id=How_Has_Charlie_Puths_Past_Relationships_Affected_His_Artistry></span>How Has Charlie Puth’s Past Relationships Affected His Artistry?<span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h2><p>His love life and past experiences inspire his songs. Charlie has been able to make relatable songs that have gone viral over the years and earned him multiple awards and nominations.&nbsp;</p><p>The “See You Again” singer is a 4-time Grammy nominee, which is no small feat. He has gotten and won several nominations at some of the music industry’s biggest award shows, such as Billboard Awards, American Music Awards, E! People’s Choice Awards, MTV Awards, Teen Choice Awards, and many more!&nbsp;</p><p>Charlie Puth continues to make music and write songs for various artists while also dating his current girlfriend, Brooke, so it’s safe to say he has beaten the gay allegations. Charlie is not the only star to have had such allegations as many other big stars in the entertainment industry, like <a href=#>Drake</a>, have been rumored to be gay.&nbsp;</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmifmajBp7HSrWWcp51ktrR5wqGYq6SZmnqxwdOhZKCZqWKus7GMrZ%2BeZaKqurC%2B0marq62VZA%3D%3D</p><h4><i class="fas fa-share-alt" aria-hidden=true></i>&nbsp;Share!</h4><ul class=share-buttons><li><a href="https://www.facebook.com/sharer/sharer.php?u=%2fis-charlie-puth-gay-are-the-rumors-true.html" target=_blank title="Share on Facebook"><i class="fab fa-facebook" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Share on Facebook</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="https://twitter.com/intent/tweet?source=%2fis-charlie-puth-gay-are-the-rumors-true.html" target=_blank title=Tweet><i class="fab fa-twitter" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Tweet</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="https://plus.google.com/share?url=%2fis-charlie-puth-gay-are-the-rumors-true.html" target=_blank title="Share on Google+"><i class="fab fa-google-plus" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Share on Google+</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="http://www.tumblr.com/share?v=3&u=%2fis-charlie-puth-gay-are-the-rumors-true.html" target=_blank title="Post to Tumblr"><i class="fab fa-tumblr" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Post to Tumblr</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="http://pinterest.com/pin/create/button/?url=%2fis-charlie-puth-gay-are-the-rumors-true.html" target=_blank title="Pin it"><i class="fab fa-pinterest-p" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Pin it</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="http://www.reddit.com/submit?url=%2fis-charlie-puth-gay-are-the-rumors-true.html" target=_blank title="Submit to Reddit"><i class="fab fa-reddit-alien" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Submit to Reddit</span></a></li></ul><style>ul.share-buttons{list-style:none;padding:0}ul.share-buttons li{display:inline}ul.share-buttons .sr-only{position:absolute;clip:rect(1px 1px 1px 1px);clip:rect(1px,1px,1px,1px);padding:0;border:0;height:1px;width:1px;overflow:hidden}</style><div class="prev-next-post pure-g"><div class=pure-u-1-24 style=text-align:left><a href=./leann-rimes-and-eddie-cibrian-engaged.html><i class="fa fa-chevron-left"></i></a></div><div class=pure-u-10-24><nav class=prev><a href=./leann-rimes-and-eddie-cibrian-engaged.html>LeAnn Rimes &amp;amp; Eddie Cibrian: Engaged!</a></nav></div><div class=pure-u-2-24>&nbsp;</div><div class=pure-u-10-24><nav class=next><a href=./taylor-swift-dixie-chicks-soon-youll-get-better-lyrics.html>Here Are The Lyrics to Taylor Swift's 'Soon You'll Get Better'</a></nav></div><div class=pure-u-1-24 style=text-align:right><a href=./taylor-swift-dixie-chicks-soon-youll-get-better-lyrics.html><i class="fa fa-chevron-right"></i></a></div></div></div></div></div><script src=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/blackburn/js/ui.js></script>
