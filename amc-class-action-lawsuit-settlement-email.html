This act prohibits video services from intentionally disclosing users' personally identifiable information to other companies without their consent.</p><p>In December 2023, following negotiations between AMC Networks and attorneys representing the subscribers, both parties reached a settlement agreement to avoid legal expenses. The administrators are now reaching out to those affected to inform them about the settlement and to urge them to submit their claims before the deadline.</p><h2 id=how-to-submit-a-claim-and-receive-your-amc-settlement-payout>How to Submit a Claim and Receive Your AMC Settlement Payout</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static1.makeuseofimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2024/02/submitting-a-claim-on-the-amc-networks-vppa-settlement-website.jpg> <strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>If you're eligible as an AMC Settlement Class Member, meaning you've received an email and used AMC services between January 18, 2021, and January 10, 2024, you can submit your claim in two ways.</p><p>The first option is to submit directly through the <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">official AMC VPPA Settlement website</a>, a quick process requiring only a few minutes of your time. Alternatively, you can download the claim form from the <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">AMC VPPA Settlement website</a> and mail the completed form postmarked by April 9, 2024.</p><p>Since the online method is faster and more secure, we recommend submitting your claim directly through the website.</p><h2 id=how-much-is-the-amc-settlement-is-it-worth-it>How Much Is the AMC Settlement?

Given the large number of individuals involved in the settlement, it's likely that each person's compensation may be less than $1, assuming all eligible individuals submit their claims by the April 9, 2024, deadline.</p><p>It's unlikely every claimant will remember, but you're still looking at a likely maximum of just a few dollars.</p><h2 id=scammers-are-posing-as-amc-settlement-administrators>Scammers Are Posing As AMC Settlement Administrators</h2><p>As settlement administrators continue to reach out to affected users, there is an increased risk of scammers attempting to pose as administrators to deceive users. To protect yourself from such scams, take the following precautions:</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><ul><li>Only submit your settlement claim through the <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">official AMC VPPA Settlement website</a>. If a <a href=#>phishing email</a> directs you to a different website, it's likely a scam.</li><li>The settlement fund will cover costs and taxes associated with the settlement. Thus, if you're asked to pay a fee to receive a substantial reward from the settlement, it's likely a scam.</li><li>Do not disclose your personal information to anyone except when submitting your claim. If an email requests personal details, mainly bank information, don't share it.</li></ul><p>If you suspect scammers have already deceived you, <a href=#>take swift action to stop the situation from escalating further</a>.</p><p>Hopefully, you now better understand why you received this email and how to proceed with your claim.
