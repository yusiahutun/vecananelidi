Spears and Timberlake dated from about 1999 until 2002 and reigned as the It couple of the era. Now, fans have a chance to relive their highly publicized relationship from Spears’s perspective, with the “Toxic” singer reflecting on the fallout of their romance in her new book.</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=3 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">Timberlake’s reps have so far not responded to various outlets’ requests regarding any of the claims Spears makes in the book, but history indicates that the exes may no longer have bad blood. Timberlake, who has been married to actor <a href=# data-vars-ga-outbound-link=https://www.harpersbazaar.com/celebrity/latest/jessica-biel-emotional-message-justin-timberlake-birthday-photos/ data-vars-ga-ux-element=Hyperlink data-vars-ga-call-to-action="Jessica Biel" class="body-link css-1gunp80 emevuu60">Jessica Biel</a> since 2012, previously spoke out in support of Spears during her legal battle to end her <a href=# data-vars-ga-outbound-link=https://www.harpersbazaar.com/celebrity/latest/a34113034/why-longtime-britney-spears-fans-are-demanding-to-freebritney/ data-vars-ga-ux-element=Hyperlink data-vars-ga-call-to-action="13-year conservatorship" class="body-link css-1gunp80 emevuu60">13-year conservatorship</a>.</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=5 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">“We should all be supporting Britney at this time. Regardless of our past, good and bad, and no matter how long ago it was… what’s happening to her is just not right,” he tweeted in June 2021. “No woman should ever be restricted from making decisions about her own body. No one should EVER be held against their will… or ever have to ask permission to access everything they’ve worked so hard for.”</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=6 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">Ahead, we break down every eyebrow-raising tale about Timberlake that the pop star recounts in her book—including cheating allegations, their bittersweet breakup, and Spears’s <a href=# data-vars-ga-outbound-link=https://www.harpersbazaar.com/celebrity/latest/a45560519/britney-spears-justin-timberlake-pregnancy-abortion-baby-memoir/ data-vars-ga-ux-element=Hyperlink data-vars-ga-call-to-action="previously unpublicized abortion" class="body-link css-1gunp80 emevuu60">previously unpublicized abortion</a>.</p><h2 data-node-id=8 class="body-h2 css-p3fpzg emevuu60">1 | Britney knew Justin “slept around” while they were in a relationship together.</h2><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=9 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">According to the singer’s claims in the book, Timberlake serially cheated on her throughout the duration of their three-year relationship.</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=10 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">“There were a couple of times during our relationship when I knew Justin had cheated on me. Especially because I was so infatuated and so in love, I let it go, even though the tabloids seemed determined to rub my face in it,” she recalls, per an excerpt quoted by <a href=# data-vars-ga-outbound-link=https://people.com/britney-spears-claims-justin-timberlake-cheated-memoir-the-woman-in-me-8374394 data-vars-ga-ux-element=Hyperlink data-vars-ga-call-to-action=People class="body-link css-1gunp80 emevuu60">People</a>. “When NSYNC went to London in 2000, photographers caught him with one of the girls from All Saints in a car. But I never said anything. At the time we’d only been together for a year.”</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=11 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">Timberlake allegedly bragged about his affairs, with one involving a now-famous individual. “Another time, we were in Vegas, and one of my dancers who’d been hanging out with him told me he’d gestured toward a girl and said, ‘Yeah, man, I hit that last night,’” she continues. “I don’t want to say who he was talking about because she’s actually very popular and she’s married with kids now. I don’t want her to feel bad.”</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=12 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">Spears says she knew about the “rumors about him with various dancers and groupies,” and although she “let it all go ... clearly, he’d slept around. It was one of those things where you know but you just don’t say anything.”</p><img alt="the 44th annual grammy awards clive davis pre grammy party" title="The 44th Annual GRAMMY Awards - Clive Davis Pre-GRAMMY Party" width=2068 height=3000 decoding=async data-nimg=1 sizes=100vw src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/hips.hearstapps.com/hmg-prod/images/justin-timberlake-britney-spears-news-photo-1698171556.jpg style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center><p><span class="css-1urwh1q e1geg53v2">J.

To me, that’s what separated them from the Backstreet Boys, who seemed very consciously to position themselves as a white group. NSYNC hung out with Black artists. Sometimes I thought they tried too hard to fit in.”</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=19 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">She recalls a specific incident during a visit to New York City, in which they encountered “a guy with a huge, blinged-out medallion who was flanked by two giant security guards.”</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=20 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">“J got all excited and said, so loud, ‘Oh yeah, fo shiz, fo shiz!

Felicia Culotta, Spears’s assistant at the time, apparently mocked Timberlake’s butchered AAVE by doing an impression of him—though that hardly fazed the *NSYNC member. “J wasn’t even embarrassed,” says Spears. “He just took it and looked at her like, Okay, fuck you, Fe.”</p><img alt="28th annual american music awards" title="28th annual American Music Awards" width=1312 height=2000 decoding=async data-nimg=1 sizes=100vw src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/hips.hearstapps.com/hmg-prod/images/britney-spears-and-justin-timberlake-arriving-at-the-28th-news-photo-1698172368.jpg style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center><p><span class="css-1urwh1q e1geg53v2">Frank Trapper</span><span class="css-5ck6gj e1geg53v0">//</span><span class="css-1urwh1q e1geg53v1">Getty Images</span></p><h2 data-node-id=22 class="body-h2 css-p3fpzg emevuu60">3 | Justin played the guitar while Britney underwent an abortion.</h2><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=23 class="body-text css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">The memoir reveals a previously unknown breaking point for Spears: that she became pregnant, and that Timberlake encouraged her to get an abortion.</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=24 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">“It was a surprise, but for me, it wasn’t a tragedy. I loved Justin so much. I always expected us to have a family together one day.

And yet Justin was so sure that he didn’t want to be a father.”</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=26 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">Getting the abortion was ultimately heartbreaking for Spears.

Only Spears, Timberlake, and Culotta were aware of the abortion, executed through Spears’s ingestion of “the little pills.”</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=30 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">“I went into the bathroom and stayed there for hours, lying on the floor, sobbing and screaming. ... I went down to the ground on my knees, holding the toilet,” Spears recounts. In an attempt to soothe her, Timberlake lay on the bathroom floor with her. “At some point he thought maybe music would help, so he got his guitar and he lay there with me, strumming it. … Still, they didn’t take me to the hospital.” Spears says the event “messed [her] up for a while, especially because I still did love Justin so much. It was insane how much I loved him, and for me, it was unfortunate.”</p><h2 data-node-id=31 class="body-h2 css-p3fpzg emevuu60">4 | He broke up with her while she was filming a music video.</h2><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=32 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">Timberlake allegedly ended their relationship via text while Spears was on the set of her <a href=# data-vars-ga-outbound-link="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-XrhNZqS4xk" data-vars-ga-ux-element=Hyperlink data-vars-ga-call-to-action="video for “Overprotected (Darkchild Remix)”" class="body-link css-1gunp80 emevuu60">video for “Overprotected (Darkchild Remix)”</a>—an even more brutal blow considering that texting was a far less common mode of communication in 2002.

When I say devastated, I mean I could barely speak for months. Whenever anyone asked me about him, all I could I do is cry. I don’t know if I was clinically in shock, but it felt that way.”</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=34 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">The breakup caused Spears to temporarily consider leaving Hollywood for good.
