However, it is not only the action in the ring that wrestling fans are passionate about. What goes on in the ring cannot be what it is without the narration of the WWE commentators. Some of the best WWE commentators have even developed larger personalities than the wrestlers.</strong></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/netstorage-tuko.akamaized.net/images/4e2aefbf04b9867e.jpg><p class=align-left>Commentators occupy an essential role in wrestling. Thanks to them, many fans have been schooled about the names of different wrestling moves such as the spear, blue thunder bomb, hurricanrana, and attitude adjustment. However, the best part is not their knowledge of these moves but the spectacularity of how they commentate.</p><h2>The best WWE commentators in pro wrestling history</h2><p class=align-left>Who is the best WWE commentator? Jim Ross, Gorilla Monsoon, and Jonathan Coachman are some of the top analysts. Here is a list of the <a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">best wrestling commentators </a>who died as well as those who are alive.</p><a class=c-article-read-also__image-wrapper href=#><img sizes=256px style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/netstorage-tuko.akamaized.net/images/4481605bfd006469.jpeg></a><a class=c-article-read-also__headline href=# readability=27><p class=c-article-read-also__caption>Read also</p><p class=c-article-read-also__headline-wrapper><span class=c-article-read-also__headline-hover-inner>15 hottest female wrestlers of all time: Who ranks top?</span></p></a><h3>1. Jim Ross</h3><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/netstorage-tuko.akamaized.net/images/4481605bfd006469.jpeg><p class=align-left>Who is the greatest wrestling commentator of all time? The 69-year-old Jim Ross is arguably the best WWE commentator of all time. He had quite a lengthy career in WWE as a play-by-play commentator. He is famously referred to as Good ol' JR because of his infectious personality and wealth of experience.</p><p class=align-left>Jim made a colourful career not only as a commentator but also as an analyst and senior advisor. His career spans a long list of franchises such as the National Wrestling Alliance, <a href=#>World</a> Championship Wrestling and World Wrestling Federation. During his time as a WWE commentator, he established himself as the <a href=#>company</a>'s voice for over a decade.</p><h3>2. Gorilla Monsoon</h3><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/netstorage-tuko.akamaized.net/images/26b5865728f86894.jpg><p class=align-left>Gorilla Monsoon, born Robert James Marella, was also a big deal in the wrestling world before his death on October 6th, 1999. He is among the wrestling commentators who died but will never be forgotten. In addition to being a play-by-play commentator, Monsoon was also a professional <a href=#>wrestler</a> and booker.</p><a class=c-article-read-also__image-wrapper href=#><img sizes=256px style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/netstorage-tuko.akamaized.net/images/96f386a24908dc1a.jpg></a><a class=c-article-read-also__headline href=# readability=27><p class=c-article-read-also__caption>Read also</p><p class=c-article-read-also__headline-wrapper><span class=c-article-read-also__headline-hover-inner>The 10 best soccer commentators you should listen to in 2021</span></p></a><p class=align-left>Inside the ring, he was viewed as a villainous super-heavyweight main eventer, but as a commentator, he was charming. In his peak years as a commentator, Monsoon was the voice of WWF. Towards the end of his career, he took up the on-screen role of WWF President for about two years.</p><p class=align-left>Monsoon served in various capacities because he had entered into an agreement with Vince McMahon. He sold him all his shares in exchange for a guarantee of lifetime employment.</p><h3>3. Joey Styles</h3><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/netstorage-tuko.akamaized.net/images/44307522e8789c7c.jpg><p class=align-left>Joseph Carmine Bonsignore, alias Joey Styles, is a former American professional wrestling <a href=#>commentator</a>. He is fondly remembered from his time in ECW and WWE and is one of the standout WWE commentators names. Before switching to wrestling as a commentator, he used to work as a full-time print advertising salesman in New York.</p><p class=align-left>As an announcer, Joey Styles was the first to call the maiden EWW One Night Stand event. Between 2005 and 2010, he was the official play-by-play commentator for Raw. However, he could not provide commentary for Wrestlemania 22 as the role was given to Jim Ross. This was because Vince McMahon preferred a storyteller kind of a commentator to pure play-by-play announcing, which was Styles' style.</p><a class=c-article-read-also__image-wrapper href=#><img sizes=256px style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/netstorage-tuko.akamaized.net/images/dac65b8daadb6b97.jpg></a><a class=c-article-read-also__headline href=# readability=27><p class=c-article-read-also__caption>Read also</p><p class=c-article-read-also__headline-wrapper><span class=c-article-read-also__headline-hover-inner>Owen Shroyer: 5 quick facts to know about the InfoWars host</span></p></a><h3>4. Jonathan Coachman</h3><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/netstorage-tuko.akamaized.net/images/96f386a24908dc1a.jpg><p class=align-left>The coachman of "The Coach" has had a distinguished career as a sports interviewer, pro wrestler, analyst and announcer. The part of his career that thrust him into the limelight was when he was part of WWE as a pre-show host for pay-per-views. He teamed up with Al Snow in a storyline feud against Jerry Lawler and Jim Ross, the Raw announce team.</p><p class=align-left>The Coach became the lead announcer of Raw in 2005 when Jim Ross was fired due to the actions of Steve Austin, who was his friend. Joey Styles would soon replace the coach as he had to settle with being the heel representative. He later rose through the ranks to be Raw’s Executive Assistant as well as Interim General Manager.</p><h3>5. Vince McMahon</h3><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/netstorage-tuko.akamaized.net/images/8f0a52b4d111f30c.png><p class=align-left>Even though he is famous for being the chairman and chief executive officer of WWE, Vince has also had successful stints as a commentator. He started as a commentator for his father when WWE was known as WWWF in the 1970s. After that, he served as the colour commentator and chief broadcaster until 1997.</p><a class=c-article-read-also__image-wrapper href=#><img sizes=256px style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/netstorage-tuko.akamaized.net/images/0bf4342c17f2a948.jpg></a><a class=c-article-read-also__headline href=# readability=27><p class=c-article-read-also__caption>Read also</p><p class=c-article-read-also__headline-wrapper><span class=c-article-read-also__headline-hover-inner>How did Flip from Street Outlaws die? The full tragic story</span></p></a><p class=align-left>McMahon had always dreamt of becoming a wrestler, but his father did not let him, arguing that promoters were never meant to appear on the show but stay apart from their wrestlers. This means that the chance to be a commentator was a compromise he readily accepted because it allowed him to appear on <a href=#>TV</a>.</p><h3>6. Bobby Heenan</h3><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/netstorage-tuko.akamaized.net/images/dac65b8daadb6b97.jpg><p class=align-left>Any commentator who graced the wrestling world in style has to be Bobby Heenan, who was also a <a href=#>comedian</a>, wrestler, and wrestling manager. He worked with the American Wrestling Association (AWA), World Wrestling Federation/Entertainment (WWE) and World Championship Wrestling. He died on September 17th, 2017, at the age of 72.</p><p class=align-left>His on-screen repartee with Gorilla Monsoon is perhaps the highlight of his career as a colour commentator. By the time he retired in the 2001 Wrestlemania X-Seven, Heenan had been a commentator in professional wrestling for seventeen years.</p><a class=c-article-read-also__image-wrapper href=#><img sizes=256px style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/netstorage-tuko.akamaized.net/images/f35fccd1bd7a43fc.jpg></a><a class=c-article-read-also__headline href=# readability=27><p class=c-article-read-also__caption>Read also</p><p class=c-article-read-also__headline-wrapper><span class=c-article-read-also__headline-hover-inner>WWE superstars salary per match: Who is the highest paid wrestler?</span></p></a><h3>7.

He is actively signed to WWE as of 2021, where he is part of the current WWE commentators. He made his WWE debut in 1992 as a wrestler. He won several championships, such as World Heavyweight Championships.</p><p class=align-left>It was in 2001 when Vince McMahon introduced Lawler on Raw as a colour commentator replacing Paul Heyman. He worked with the likes of Jim Ross and Michael Cole. While most commentators' styles incorporate aspects of storytelling, Lawler preferred a reactive and vibrant style.</p><h3>8. Jesse Ventura</h3><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/netstorage-tuko.akamaized.net/images/e7c1f2d3b3cfb25c.jpg><p class=align-left>Jesse Ventura 'The Body' is a former professional wrestler, commentator and politician.

Paul Heyman</h3><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/netstorage-tuko.akamaized.net/images/0bf4342c17f2a948.jpg><p class=align-left>Paul Heyman will go down as one of the best wrestling managers/advocates having managed a record six WWE Champions. These are Kurt Angle, Big Show, Rob Van Dam, CM Punk, and Brock Lesnar. However, this does not negate his abilities on the microphone, as his style has always stood out.</p><p class=align-left>Heyman was recruited as a WWF commentator on Raw is War in 2001, replacing Jerry Lawler. Heyman used this opportunity to ignite a storyline rivalry with Jim Ross. However, he was still a commentator when he recreated ECW as a stable. He was later fired and replaced by Lawler.</p><h3>10. Eric Bischoff</h3><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/netstorage-tuko.akamaized.net/images/eee90a0f858931e2.jpg><p class=align-left>The former Executive Producer and Senior Vice President of World Championship Wrestling are among the greatest wrestling commentators of his generation.

Lance Russell</h3><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/netstorage-tuko.akamaized.net/images/f35fccd1bd7a43fc.jpg><p class=align-left>Lance Russell may not have had the opportunity to be a commentator for WWE.

The WWF will remember him for the one year from April 1989 in which he was the primary play-by-play announcer for both the SummerSlam 1989 and Royal Rumble 1990.</p><h3>14. John Bradshaw Layfield</h3><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/netstorage-tuko.akamaized.net/images/f6feabbb94bb397d.jpg><p class=align-left>John Layfield is a businessman, TV personality, professional wrestler and commentator.

He was the lead commentator for NXT in its first three seasons, but he started showing arrogance to wrestlers and fans alike, resulting in a feud with Jerry Lawler.</p><p class=align-left>The best WWE commentators in pro wrestling history will always stand out for the trademark ways they announced wrestling matches. No one can question the dedication of these commentators as they always brought out their A-game to add colour to the already exciting contests.
