The founders of Hug Sleep, husband-wife duo Matt Mundt and Angie Kupper, pitched their product on <i>Shark Tank</i>, where they bagged an excellent deal with Mark Cuban and Lori Greiner.</p><h2>What is Hug Sleep's net worth?</h2><p class=align-left>The company has an estimated net worth of <a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">$5 million</a> as of 2023. However, when it appeared on <i>Shark Tank</i>, its net worth was approximately $1.5 million. Appearing on <i>Shark Tank</i> boosted the company’s sales and overall worth.</p><a class=c-article-read-also__image-wrapper href=#><img sizes=256px style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/netstorage-tuko.akamaized.net/images/285e4b418fddea1f.jpg></a><a class=c-article-read-also__headline href=# readability=27><p class=c-article-read-also__caption>Read also</p><p class=c-article-read-also__headline-wrapper><span class=c-article-read-also__headline-hover-inner>Island Boys before tattoos: Here's how they looked back then</span></p></a><p class=align-left>Apart from the famous Hug Sleep Pod, it has earned huge income from its <a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">other products</a>, such as:</p><ul><li>Sleep Poe Move for adults</li><li>Hooded Sleep Pod Move</li><li>Sleep Pod</li><li>Sleep Pod Move for kids</li></ul><h2>What is a Hug Sleep pod?</h2><p class=align-left>It is a comfortable swaddle for adults founded by <a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">Matt Mundt and Angie Kupper. </a>Matt wanted to try the weighted blankets immediately after they became a trend. Initially, their pressure was comforting, but later, he discovered that the weighted blankets trapped a lot of heat. In addition, he found they were hard to wash.</p><p class=align-left>As a result, he thought of designing a more comfortable blanket. Therefore, they opted to use compression instead of weight to apply deep-touch pressure technology. Matt and his wife thus created an adult swaddle enough to wrap a person’s entire body. It was called the Sleep Pod and was launched in 2019 under Hug Sleep.</p><a class=c-article-read-also__image-wrapper href=#><img sizes=256px style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/netstorage-tuko.akamaized.net/images/438f9111a242e04f.png></a><a class=c-article-read-also__headline href=# readability=27><p class=c-article-read-also__caption>Read also</p><p class=c-article-read-also__headline-wrapper><span class=c-article-read-also__headline-hover-inner>Muthoni Ngugi’s Rise from Waitress to Making Over KSh 5m Monthly</span></p></a><h2>Who are the owners of Hug Sleep?</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/netstorage-tuko.akamaized.net/images/285e4b418fddea1f.jpg><p class=align-left>The product is owned by a husband-wife duo, Matt Mundt and Angie Kupper. The lovely couple hails from Milwaukee, Wisconsin. Mundt has a degree in mechanical engineering, while her wife has a <a href=#>master's degree</a> in community psychology.</p><p class=align-left>After Angie’s mother committed suicide, she became passionate about helping people struggling with different mental illnesses. Therefore, after completing her studies, she worked as a therapist in the mental health industry for over a decade.</p><p class=align-left>On the other hand, her husband began working as a product designer for several renowned companies in the <a id=https://www.tuko.co.ke/facts-lifehacks/study/464633-15-technical-courses-kenya-2022/ href=#>mechanical engineering</a> sector.</p><h2>Hug Sleep on Shark Tank</h2><p class=align-left>Initially, Matt and Angie were bootstrapping their Hug Sleep startup and re-investing revenue to grow their <a href=#>business</a>. Later, they appeared on <i>Shark Tank </i>season two, asking for $150,000 capital for a 10% equity stake.</p><a class=c-article-read-also__image-wrapper href=#><img sizes=256px style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/netstorage-tuko.akamaized.net/images/ee1d2561af0d854c.jpg></a><a class=c-article-read-also__headline href=# readability=27><p class=c-article-read-also__caption>Read also</p><p class=c-article-read-also__headline-wrapper><span class=c-article-read-also__headline-hover-inner>Who died on Homestead Rescue?

Even though <a href=#>their business</a> was at an early-stage startup, its revenue grew each quarterly. For instance, they made a lifetime sale of $490,000 with $140,000 as the net profit. Hug Sleep Pod was retailing at $99.000 while the customer acquisition was only $11.50.</p><p class=align-left>This created a tough bidding war and an unlikely situation where all five sharks made separate offers. Robert, Daymond and Kevin ganged up and offered <a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">$300,000 for a 20% equity stake.</a> On the other hand, Lori Greiner and Mark Cuban teamed up, made the same offer and were chosen.</p><h2>Hug Sleep after Shark Tank</h2><p class=align-left>What is Hug Sleep net worth after <i>Shark Tank</i>? The company has an estimated net worth of $5 million as of 2023.

This made $2.5 million in sales. After three months of successfully running the business, the number escalated to $4.1 million.</p><p class=align-left>This was a huge surprise for the duo because they only expected to sell between 3,000 and 4,000 Hug Sleep Pods after appearing on <i>Shark Tank.</i> Therefore, 25,000 was way above their target. From the enormous success, the duo created and released a similar Hug Sleep Pod for children but with a hood.</p><h2>Hug Sleep’s fast facts</h2><li>How much has Hug Sleep made?
