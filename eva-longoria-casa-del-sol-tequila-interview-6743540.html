She rose to international stardom in 2004 with the debut of Desperate Housewives, where she took on the character of Gabriella Solis — the well-off wife of Carlos, played by Ricardo Antonio Chavira — and has since starred, produced, and directed dozens of on-screen projects. But "actor" is only one of Longoria's many titles.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_3-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">Off-screen, she's an activist, podcast host, entrepreneur, mother, and most importantly a proud Mexican-American — all of which fuel her sense of purpose.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_5-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">Take her podcast, <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=externalLink data-ordinal=1 rel=nofollow>Connections</a>, as an example. In each 30-ish minute episode, she has thought-provoking conversations with leaders across various industries and gives a platform to many Latinx voices. (Check out her <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=externalLink data-ordinal=2 rel=nofollow>episode with Chilean author Isabel Allende</a> where they cover the topic of aging — it's a treat). Then, there's the film projects she produces: such as the <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=externalLink data-ordinal=3>Reversing Roe </a>documentary — and the ones she directs — such as the upcoming "<a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=externalLink data-ordinal=4>Flamin' Hot</a>" feature, which shares the story of Richard Montañez, a Mexican-American janitor who invented who came up with the Cheetos spinoff and disrupted the food industry. In 2023, she's starring in CNN's upcoming six-part series, <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=externalLink data-ordinal=5>Eva Longoria: Searching For Mexico</a> — a spin-off of Stanley Tucci's hit show <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=externalLink data-ordinal=6>Searching for Italy</a> — where she'll travel to different regions in Mexico to discover their cuisines and uncover hidden gems. Most recently, though, Longoria launched a tequila brand that's more than just something to add to your bar cart — it's a vessel for female upliftment.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_7-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">"<a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=externalLink data-ordinal=1>Casa Del Sol </a>is an amazing tequila brand, and I know this is going to sound crazy, but it's Mexican-owned," she jokes to InStyle during an Instagram Live. "Our distillery is 100% Mexican-owned, and that's really rare."</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_11-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">She goes on to elaborate on why having a Mexican-owned tequila brand is so important, pointing out that many companies on the market right now only feature white men on motorcycles for their ads. If you know, you know.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_13-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">"When I joined Casa Del Sol, I was so impressed that it was Mexican-forward, it was about Mexican heritage, it was about honoring the region.... and keeping the success there — not just going into this region, exploiting it, and selling tequila over the world."</p><figure id=mntl-sc-block_15-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block instyle-sc-block-image mntl-sc-block-universal-image mntl-sc-block-image--no-theme no-theme mntl-sc-block-image figure-landscape figure-high-res"><span class=figure-article-caption-text>Eva Longoria presents Casa del Sol tequila.</span> <span class=figure-article-caption-owner><p>Casa del Sol</p></span></figure><p id=mntl-sc-block_16-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"><br>Beyond the actual tequila — of which Casa del Sol offers three types: añejo, blanco, and reposado — the company does a lot of work to empower the workers and honor the land.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_18-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">"We have a lot of women in key positions. Tequila's the number one spirit preferred by women, and yet you don't see a lot of female tequilas. Not that this tequila is for women, but our master distiller is a woman, which is really rare," she begins. "Our CEO of the distillery is a fourth generation tequila maker, first woman to take over the distillery. We have our VP of operations is a woman. Almost our entire team are women, and that's important. [This] is not a celebrity brand, it's a tequila brand that is Mexican-forward and honoring and supporting all the amazing women behind it, trying to forge a path for themselves in a very macho industry."</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_22-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">Apart from the making of the tequila, Longoria shares that there are women who work on the vegan leather necks that go on the bottles from the comfort of their homes.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_24-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">"We send this material to their houses, they cut it, they stamp it, they sew it, and they send it to the factory and then we can compensate them for that work," she describes. And doing so gives them the opportunity to make a fair wage without having to abandon their families and responsibilities in the home, which in turn gives them financial independence.<br></p><p id=mntl-sc-block_26-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">Longoria is well-versed in the space of uplifting women. After all, she has partnered with L'Oréal Paris's <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=externalLink data-ordinal=1 rel=nofollow>Women of Worth</a> initiative for nearly 20 years. The annual program gives 10 women $20,000 each to support their charitable causes, giving more depth to the brand's signature slogan: "Because you're worth it."</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_28-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">"To be part of a company that their sole mission is to make sure you value yourself worth really has been an honor," says Longoria of their ongoing partnership.<br></p><p id=mntl-sc-block_32-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">As time has gone by, not only has Longoria's career flourished, but her relationship to aging has as well. When speaking about what it was like to watch herself grow up on television, she laughed and pointed out how humorous it is when people ask what she does to stop aging. "You can't! It's going to happen — I embrace it," she says, adding that she associates aging with wisdom, intellect, experience, and the evolution of who she is.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_34-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">"That doesn't mean I don't like to take care of myself. I do lasers and peels and massages and creams and hyaluronic acid. I want to look my best, but it doesn't own me."</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_36-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">Cheers to that! And of course, we cheers with a Casa del Sol margarita — Longoria's favorite drink.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7qrrSrbClnV6YvK57xK%2BYZqSfo7SwvsiaZJyZo5Z6pbHLZqqopF2psrLByKWYZqGeqbKzwsiermZuZ2mAdoCP</p><h4><i class="fas fa-share-alt" aria-hidden=true></i>&nbsp;Share!</h4><ul class=share-buttons><li><a href="https://www.facebook.com/sharer/sharer.php?u=%2feva-longoria-casa-del-sol-tequila-interview-6743540.html" target=_blank title="Share on Facebook"><i class="fab fa-facebook" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Share on Facebook</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="https://twitter.com/intent/tweet?source=%2feva-longoria-casa-del-sol-tequila-interview-6743540.html" target=_blank title=Tweet><i class="fab fa-twitter" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Tweet</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="https://plus.google.com/share?url=%2feva-longoria-casa-del-sol-tequila-interview-6743540.html" target=_blank title="Share on Google+"><i class="fab fa-google-plus" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Share on Google+</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="http://www.tumblr.com/share?v=3&u=%2feva-longoria-casa-del-sol-tequila-interview-6743540.html" target=_blank title="Post to Tumblr"><i class="fab fa-tumblr" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Post to Tumblr</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="http://pinterest.com/pin/create/button/?url=%2feva-longoria-casa-del-sol-tequila-interview-6743540.html" target=_blank title="Pin it"><i class="fab fa-pinterest-p" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Pin it</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="http://www.reddit.com/submit?url=%2feva-longoria-casa-del-sol-tequila-interview-6743540.html" target=_blank title="Submit to Reddit"><i class="fab fa-reddit-alien" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Submit to Reddit</span></a></li></ul><style>ul.share-buttons{list-style:none;padding:0}ul.share-buttons li{display:inline}ul.share-buttons .sr-only{position:absolute;clip:rect(1px 1px 1px 1px);clip:rect(1px,1px,1px,1px);padding:0;border:0;height:1px;width:1px;overflow:hidden}</style><div class="prev-next-post pure-g"><div class=pure-u-1-24 style=text-align:left><a href=./iowas-sales-tax-holiday-helps-families-save-money-on-back-to-school-shopping.html><i class="fa fa-chevron-left"></i></a></div><div class=pure-u-10-24><nav class=prev><a href=./iowas-sales-tax-holiday-helps-families-save-money-on-back-to-school-shopping.html>Iowas sales tax holiday helps families save money on back to school shopping</a></nav></div><div class=pure-u-2-24>&nbsp;</div><div class=pure-u-10-24><nav class=next><a href=./elizabeth-hurley-wows-in-a-hot-pink-dress-and-heels-photos.html>Elizabeth Hurley Wows in a Hot Pink Dress and Matching Pumps in New York City: Photos</a></nav></div><div class=pure-u-1-24 style=text-align:right><a href=./elizabeth-hurley-wows-in-a-hot-pink-dress-and-heels-photos.html><i class="fa fa-chevron-right"></i></a></div></div></div></div></div><script src=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/blackburn/js/ui.js></script>
