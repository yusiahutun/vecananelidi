The 66-year-old has directed what many consider rom-com classics, like Love Actually, the Bridget Jones films and Notting Hill.</strong></p><p>In a conversation with his daughter, activist and writer Scarlett Curtis, he said: “I was just sort of stupid and wrong about that” and blamed his non-diverse social circles and noted that he got “hung on the diversity issue”.</p><figure class="wp-block-grvmedia-grv-video GRVMultiVideo"></figure><h2 class=wp-block-heading id=h-the-director-regrets-the-way-he-handled-things>The director regrets the way he handled things</h2><p>Speaking at the Times and Sunday Times Cheltenham Literature Festival, which was held between October 5 and 15, the <a href=#>Hollywood</a> director opened up.</p><p>He said of Notting Hill, which starred Julia Roberts opposite Hugh Grant: “I think because I came from a very un-diverse school and a bunch of university friends.</p><p>“(With) ‘Notting Hill,’ I think that I hung on to the diversity issue, to the feeling that I wouldn’t know how to write those parts. And I think I was just sort of stupid and wrong about that.”&nbsp;</p><p>Scarlett noted that the film was set in the district, which is noted for a number of civil-rights-related riots in 1958 and its many Windrush immigrant residents at that time.</p><p>Richard responded: “I feel as though me, my casting director, my producers just didn’t think about it. Just didn’t look outwards enough.”</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/cdn1.celebritytidbit.com/uploads/39/2023/10/Screenshot-2023-10-19-at-15.31.15-1024x511.png><h2 class=wp-block-heading id=h-love-actually-director-admits-he-was-behind-the-curve>Love Actually director admits he was ‘behind the curve’</h2><p>In both Bridget Jones and Love Actually, both Bridget (<a href=#>Renée Zellweger</a>) and Natalie (Martine McCutcheon) – who is described as having “massive, tree trunk thighs” – are conscious about their weight. In the movies, the other characters making unwanted, negative comments about their physical appearance and are harassed by male colleagues at work.</p><p>Saying that his daughter was “right” about not being able to use the word “fat,” Richard explained how he feels now.</p><p>“I think I was behind, you know, behind the curve, and those jokes aren’t any longer funny, so I don’t feel I was malicious at the time, but I think I was unobservant and not as, you know, as clever as I should have been,” the <a href=#>Love Actually</a> director admitted.</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading id=h-renee-zellweger-said-weight-discussions-saddened-her>Renée Zellweger said weight discussions “saddened” her</h2><p>In a resurfaced clip from an interview she did with Oprah, the <a href=#>celebrity</a> said that she got asked a lot about her weight loss and she didn’t like to answer.</p><p>She said: “It saddens me so much because it seems to imply that one way of being is acceptable and the other isn’t valuable, and that’s just not true.</p><p>“And did you know, I was told this while we were filming, did you know that Bridget Jones was voted the most sexy personality, on-screen, whatever personality in England? I thought wow, that right there completely nullifies the notion that you’re supposed to be a size zero in order to be considered attractive, don’t you think?”</p><p>Related Topics</p><p>MORE CELEBRITY STORIES</p><span></span><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7pLHLnpmroaSuwaqwwaKrZ5ufonxzfJFsZmpoX2aGcLDIq5ycrJ%2BnerCyjJyfq6Gjqbqiv4ympq%2BhlWKwra3SrKCcZaKatLOx06xkoa2iqbO2uIysmp6mlah6orLTnqlmnJGqtKnAxKuqZqqVlrC1tc6nZg%3D%3D</p><h4><i class="fas fa-share-alt" aria-hidden=true></i>&nbsp;Share!</h4><ul class=share-buttons><li><a href="https://www.facebook.com/sharer/sharer.php?u=%2fdirector-of-christmas-movie-classic-regrets-hurtful-scenes-after-daughters-reaction.html" target=_blank title="Share on Facebook"><i class="fab fa-facebook" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Share on Facebook</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="https://twitter.com/intent/tweet?source=%2fdirector-of-christmas-movie-classic-regrets-hurtful-scenes-after-daughters-reaction.html" target=_blank title=Tweet><i class="fab fa-twitter" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Tweet</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="https://plus.google.com/share?url=%2fdirector-of-christmas-movie-classic-regrets-hurtful-scenes-after-daughters-reaction.html" target=_blank title="Share on Google+"><i class="fab fa-google-plus" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Share on Google+</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="http://www.tumblr.com/share?v=3&u=%2fdirector-of-christmas-movie-classic-regrets-hurtful-scenes-after-daughters-reaction.html" target=_blank title="Post to Tumblr"><i class="fab fa-tumblr" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Post to Tumblr</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="http://pinterest.com/pin/create/button/?url=%2fdirector-of-christmas-movie-classic-regrets-hurtful-scenes-after-daughters-reaction.html" target=_blank title="Pin it"><i class="fab fa-pinterest-p" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Pin it</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="http://www.reddit.com/submit?url=%2fdirector-of-christmas-movie-classic-regrets-hurtful-scenes-after-daughters-reaction.html" target=_blank title="Submit to Reddit"><i class="fab fa-reddit-alien" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Submit to Reddit</span></a></li></ul><style>ul.share-buttons{list-style:none;padding:0}ul.share-buttons li{display:inline}ul.share-buttons .sr-only{position:absolute;clip:rect(1px 1px 1px 1px);clip:rect(1px,1px,1px,1px);padding:0;border:0;height:1px;width:1px;overflow:hidden}</style><div class="prev-next-post pure-g"><div class=pure-u-1-24 style=text-align:left><a href=./meghan-markle-heavy-make-up-black-outfit-queens-funeral.html><i class="fa fa-chevron-left"></i></a></div><div class=pure-u-10-24><nav class=prev><a href=./meghan-markle-heavy-make-up-black-outfit-queens-funeral.html>Duchess Meghan looks refined in wide-brimmed Hepburn hat and heavy makeup for the Queen's funeral</a></nav></div><div class=pure-u-2-24>&nbsp;</div><div class=pure-u-10-24><nav class=next><a href=./diane-holechek.html>Who is Dianne Holechek dating?
