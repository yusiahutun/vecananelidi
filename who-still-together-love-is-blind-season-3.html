During the 10 days, the couples can decide if they want to get engaged—still sight unseen. After the proposal, the couples meet face-to-face for the first time and go on vacation at a resort in Mexico, where they learn more about each other and meet the other couples. After the trip, the couples, who all live in the same city, return to the real world and move into an apartment together as they meet each other’s families and friends and prepare for their weddings. At the altar on their wedding days, the couples must decide whether to marry or breakup as they answer the age-old question of if love can be truly blind.</p><p>Related Stories</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/stylecaster.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/03/Outlander.jpg> <img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/stylecaster.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/Outlander.jpg><p>Since the premiere of <a href=# rel=noopener>Love Is Blind</a>, the show has become one of Netflix’s highest-rated series, with more than 30 million views in its first two months. “Across the world, everybody feels the same way: Everyone wants to be loved for who they are on the inside. It doesn’t matter where you live, what you look like, how old you are, what your background is, which class you know, or social structure you feel like you’re a part of, everyone wants to be loved for who they are,” creator Chris Coelen told Variety in 2020. “In today’s society we’ve got all these ways to find love through dating apps and technology. Those things sort of counterintuitively have made people feel disposable. They’ve made people feel like it’s all surface level. It does the opposite thing it was supposed to do. So we thought, what if we took everybody’s devices away, how could we get them to focus on connecting with other people?”</p><p>Coelen also told <a href=# rel=noopener>Variety</a> about how&nbsp;the connections on <a href=# rel=noopener>Love Is Blind</a> were based on choice, which is why the relationships were that much stronger. “It was incredibly scary because nobody had to do anything, versus a show like we do Married at First Sight, you sign up and you know, you’re getting married to a stranger. Here, nobody had to do anything. It was if you find someone, if you choose. Which is so scary. They don’t have to go through with the wedding ceremony,” he said. “But assuming they found someone, could that love overcome any judgment in the real world? That’s an incredibly fascinating question. And that’s what we set out to try to examine.”</p><p>But back to the couples from Love Is Blind season 3. So…<a href=# rel=noopener>who’s still together from Love Is Blind season 3</a> and where are Alexa and Brennon; Bartise and Nancy; Cole and Zanab; Raven and SK; and Colleen and Matt now after the show finished filming? Read on for what we know about who’s still together from Love Is Blind season 3 and what happened to all the engaged couples.</p><h2>Who’s still together from Love Is Blind season 3?</h2><p>Who’s still together from Love Is Blind season 3? Read on for what we know about where the Love Is Blind 2022 couples are now and what happened after The Pods.</p><h2>Are Alexa and Brennon still together after Love Is Blind season 3?</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/stylecaster.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/10/Alexa-Brennon-Love-Is-Blind-Season-3.png><p><strong>Relationship status</strong>: Married</p><p>Are Alexa and Brennon still together after Love Is Blind season 3? The answer is yes. Alexa and Brennon were one of two couples who said “I do” at the altar of their wedding day in episode 11 of Love Is Blind season 3. The other couple was Colleen Reed and Matt Bolton. Alexa and Brennon confirmed they were still together in the Love Is Blind season 3 “After the Altar” special in February 2023.</p><p>Alexa and Brennon married on June 30, 2021, according to the marriage license filed in the County of Dallas, Texas. The license listed Alexa Danielle Alfia as applicant one, and Brennon Taylor Lemieux as applicant two. The license was recorded on July 16, 2021, and seemed to confirm Alexa and Brennon married in the Love Is Blind season 3 finale three days before Colleen and Matt, who married on July 2, 2021. “Never in a million years did I think that I would find the love of my life on the other side of a pod wall. You make me laugh, you make me think and more than anything else, you make me happy. I can’t wait to build the rest of our futures together. I promise to give you the jingle-jangle for the rest of forever,” Alexa told Brennon at the altar of their wedding.</p><p>Alexa and Brennon confirmed they were still together and married in the Love Is Blind season 3 reunion. They also revealed they had moved into a two-bedroom apartment together. In an interview with <a href=# rel="noopener nofollow">Elite Daily</a> after the Love Is Blind season 3 reunion, Alexa revealed how she knew she wanted to say “I do” to Brennon. There was never an exact moment,” she said. “It was just never a no. Once I was just like, ‘He’s my person on the other side,’ you just keep going with that…All the way up to wedding day, we were questioning it … ‘Should we be fighting more?’ And it just never happened.” Brennon, for his part, told the site that it was Alexa’s values and personality that made him realize he wanted her to be his wife.&nbsp;“She has this way of talking, communicating, and letting you see how she’s so much fun on the outside, but really on the inside, she’s so sweet and so she’s into family and all the values in life that I hold dear,” he said. “It really just stuck out. I went from, ‘Man, I really like this person’ to ‘I love this person,’ to ‘I’m in love with this person. I’m going to marry them. Whether it happens here or in person, whether we’re on the show, off the show, we’re getting married, it’s done.’”</p><p>Before the Love Is Blind season 3 finale aired, there was speculation over Alexa and Brennon’s relationship status based on their social media. Though Alexa and Brennon didn’t follow each other on Instagram, Brennon, who only followed around 150 people on Instagram, Brennon did follow a few of Alexa’s close friends on Instagram, including a friend named <a href=# rel="noopener nofollow">America</a>, a friend named <a href=# rel="noopener nofollow">Orel Pilo</a>, a friend named <a href=# rel="noopener nofollow">Cara Abramov</a> and a friend named <a href=# rel="noopener nofollow">Darshir Brewington</a>.</p><p>Alexa and Brennon were also friends on Venmo, though they hadn’t sent any payments to each other. Alexa was also Venmo friends with Raven Ross, another contestant from Love Is Blind season 3, while Brennon was friends with SK Alagbada, another contestant from Love Is Blind season 3, who was in a couple with Raven. “Foodddddd,” Raven wrote in a Venmo transaction to Alexa in October 2022. Raven and Colleen Reed, another contestant from Love Is Blind season 3, also Venmoed Alexa’s family member about what seemed to be a second Bachelorette party for Alexa in March 2022. “Bach pt 2,” Raven wrote in one transaction. She also wrote in another transaction, “Alexa cabana boys.”</p><p>In an interview with<a href=# rel="noopener nofollow"> Women’s Health</a> after Love Is Blind season 3, Alexa reacted to a scene where her father jokingly brought out a set of knives after Brennon confirmed he would convert to Judaism for Alexa. “My mom made a decision early on in my life,” she said. “I had no idea that that had happened. And [Brennon] was like, ‘You know, your dad threatened me with circumcision.’ My dad is very funny. I think it was also like a test to see how Brennan would react to something just funny like that.”</p><p>Who is Alexa from Love Is Blind season 3? Alexa Alfia is a 27-year-old from Dallas, Texas.

The answer is no. Bartise and Nancy broke up in episode 11 of Love Is Blind season 3 after Bartise told Nancy “I do not” at the altar of their wedding. “We’re absolutely best friends, yes, but what I’ve gone through in the real world with you, with your family, with everything we talked about, there’s no way for me in my head that it makes sense to get up there and say ‘yes,'” Bartise told Nancy after he broke up with her. The County of Dallas’ official public records system also confirmed Bartise and Nancy didn’t get married at the same time as the other married Love Is Blind season 3 couples, as the county’s search system didn’t have a record of their marriage license.</p><p>During the Love Is Blind season 3 reunion, Bartise and Nancy confirmed they weren’t back together and were still broken up. Nancy also accused Bartise of going on a date with a “tall blonde” the “next day” after their wedding. “He had a tall blonde by his side. I just saw some things on social media. It was posting a video of the scene, and you caught Bartise and this tall blonde next to him and then that same tall blonde over the weekend on his lap, all over him. To me, it goes back to, ‘The fuck?'” Nancy said. Bartise confirmed he was with a blonde in the video Nancy saw but didn’t hook up with her until a few days later. “Yes, there was a blonde girl with me, but that night, nothing happened. Something eventually happened on July 4th on a boat. There was a lot of drinking and a lot of coping I was doing. To be honest, I don’t think my sex life is anybody’s business,” Bartise said.</p><p>In an interview with <a href=# rel="noopener nofollow">People</a> after the Love Is Blind season 3 reunion, Nancy explained that she and Bartise have a “respectful” relationship with one another but weren’t back together. “Right after the wedding, we took time apart,” she said. “I think for me, you saw me, I was like, ‘It’s black and white. You said no. I’m out.’ I had to do that to protect myself, because at that point I was so blindsided that I needed to process how did this happen?” She continued, “Rewatching it, it was like, ‘Oh, that’s how it happened.’ I would hope that Bartise and I could be friends at some point and later on in life, maybe in his 30s, we can be friends. But I don’t see the benefit of us being friends at this point.”</p><p>Bartise also told People that he would consider Nancy closer to an “acquaintance” than a friend. <span>“Right now, we are, I would call [us] acquaintances,” he said. “Our depiction on Love Is Blind was very much a rollercoaster. It was up and down, and that’s continued to be what it has been — but not romantic. So we’ve gone from friends to acquaintances, to no communication to disliking each other, back to friends, and right now, I would say we’re acquaintances.”</span></p><p>Nancy also explained her brother and mother’s heated reactions to her and Bartise’s breakup. “My brother and Bartise were about the same age, so my brother got it. And when [Bartise] said no, I had to shut down my feelings and I even said to Bartise, ‘It’s okay.’ Those were my first words when we got outside. So my mom and my brother fought the fight that I couldn’t fight in that moment,” she said. Bartise told the magazine that he “absolutely understand[s] where they’re coming from” and why Nancy’s family was so mad at him.</p><p>“I have a younger sister, so I would have the same emotions that they’re having. However, I wanted me and Nancy to have that moment so I could explain to her everything that was going through my mind and my reasonings behind saying, ‘I do not,'” he said. “And her mom and her brother were not letting me do that. So I was getting very frustrated because that was me and Nancy’s moment. That was our experience. That was the culmination of this whole Love Is Blind process for us, and they were getting in the way of that.” He continued, “But at the same time, I think their feelings were warranted because that’s their baby girl.”</p><p>Nancy also told People that she didn’t have any regrets over her experience on Love Is Blind and would do the show again, but she wouldn’t date another 25-year-old like Bartise.&nbsp;&nbsp;“I think for me, the person I did the experience with was the person that I was supposed to be with and I wouldn’t have changed that,” she said. “So would I do this all over again? Absolutely. Would I do it with a 25-year-old? No, thank you.”</p><p>Bartise also told People that he didn’t have any regrets over his experience on Love Is Blind. “I love my journey with Nancy because, especially watching it back and watching myself, kind of feeling embarrassed to have watched myself say some of the stuff that I said and ashamed of myself,” he says. “I like that journey because I’m able to learn from it and grow from it.” He continued, “I learned that I need to be more sensitive to my partner’s emotions and not speak my mind to the fullest at all times, which I put my foot in my mouth.”</p><p>Prior to the Love Is Blind season 3 reunion, the finale trailer seemed to spoil that Bartise and Nancy weren’t still together. In one scene, Nancy could be seen walking down the aisle toward the altar with her father. Another scene later showed her walking away from the aisle with a woman dressed in black as the guests around them looked shocked, which hinted that Bartise and Nancy didn’t say “I do.”</p><p>Before the Love Is Blind season 3 finale aired, there was speculation over Bartise and Nancy’s relationship based on their social media behavior. As of writing this, both Nancy and Bartise follow each other on Instagram. They’re also friends on Venmo, though they haven’t made any payments to each other. Nancy also hinted at change in her life in an <a href=# rel="noopener nofollow">Instagram post</a> in September 2021, around the time she and Barnett would’ve finished filming Love Is Blind season 3, though it’s unclear what that change was. “🍂🍃Change is good 🍃 🍂 ✨Leaves change with seasons, just like we have seasons in our lives… so let’s embrace those changes in our lives! ✨ #fall #is #comingsoon #season #change #grateful #happy #latina,” she captioned the post.</p><p>In an interview with <a href=# rel="noopener nofollow">Women’s Health</a> after Love Is Blind season 3, Bartise reacted to a scene where another contestant, Andrew Liu, who also dated Nancy, used fake tears to seem more emotional on camera. “The final 10 people took the experiment as seriously as possible, and I’m not going to speak for the other 20 people,” he said. He also told the magazine about how he chose Nancy’s engagement ring.&nbsp;“I think we had an option of like seven to 10 rings to rate based on the pod day, because that’s something you would talk about on a pod date with your potential fiancé is ‘what kind of ring do you like?'” he said. “So, the guys had to rate which ones we thought our women would like the most.”</p><p><span>Who is Bartise from </span>Love Is Blind<span> season 3?

The answer is no. Cole and Zanab broke up in episode 11 of Love Is Blind season 3 after Zanab told Cole “I do not” at the altar of their wedding. “Cole, you have taught me so much about myself in the last two months, and you have shared so much of who you are, and I am so thankful for that. I think I have a really good idea about the type of woman that’s gonna love you the way that Cole needs to be loved every day for the rest of your life, and I think you and I both know that is not me,” Zanab told Cole as she broke up with him. “As much as I have wanted it to be me and have tried to manipulate myself to be that person for you, the last two months have not been picture-perfect.” She continued, “You have disrespected me. You have insulted me. You have critiqued me, and for what it’s worth, you have single-handedly shattered my self-confidence, and I hate that you have had that kind of effect on me. And the messed-up thing is I know I love you, but everything in me and the logical part of my brain tells me that love shouldn’t feel this way. Love shouldn’t hurt like this. I can’t marry you, and I don’t.”</p><p>The County of Dallas’ official public records system also confirmed Cole and Zanab didn’t get married at the same time as the other married Love Is Blind season 3 couples, as the county’s search system didn’t have a record of their marriage license. During the Love Is Blind season 3 reunion, Cole and Zanab confirmed they weren’t back together and were still broken up. Zanab also accused Cole of making comments about her weight and diet while they were engaged, which were edited out of Love Is Blind. “The pushing food away from me. Asking me if I’m going to eat that. Trying to get me to order a salad. The daily comments about my face and my body were not used. That’s great because it really did protect you, and you are now denying it and now calling me a liar in front of all these people,” Zanab said. Zanab also accused Cole of questioning if she should eat two tangerines, which he denied. Love Is Blind later confirmed Zanab’s story after the reunion by showing a clip of the scene.</p><p>In an interview with <a href=# rel="noopener nofollow">People</a> after the Love Is Blind season 3 reunion, Zanab confirmed she and Cole “do not speak” after their breakup. “I did not stand up there and say no to the Cole that everyone got to see. There was a lot more,” she said. “I stand by everything I said…We do not speak. We didn’t really leave a friendship or a mutual respect, I think, for each other to have. So there isn’t communication between the two of us.” Cole, for his part,claimed that he and Zanab still talk but they’ve both moved on from each other. “Zay and I are having a lot of hard conversations and working through a lot of our baggage from our relationship,” he said. “We talked a few weeks ago, and then we just recently here in the last week have been talking a lot. So we care about each other a lot, but we have a lot of pain from our past.”</p><p>According to Zanab, another issue in her and Cole’s relationship was that his family refused to be a part of their Love Is Blind journey, which Zanab struggled to move on from because she had lost both of her biological parents. She told People that she believed her and Cole’s relationship could have ended differently if his family was a part of their relationship. “I really do,” she said. Not to toot my own horn; parents love me. I would’ve loved the chance to meet them, win them over, maybe if Cole had the support of his family. I did get to meet some of his friends and they said, ‘Wow, we love her for you.’ I do think when we had our highs, I brought out a different side of Cole and I think maybe we wouldn’t have ended up where we did. So I do think it could have made a difference? Absolutely.”</p><p>Despite her breakup with Cole, Zanab also told People that she didn’t have any regrets over her experience on Love Is Blind. “Cole was my person. Cole was the only person in that experiment for me, so I am glad I chose him. I’m glad he taught me what he did, and I’m glad I got to see who he really is,” she said. Cole, for his part, revealed that there were parts of his experience he would change. “It’s obvious with my story, I think we all know the things that I could change,” he said. “But one thing I think hasn’t been spoken to a lot is that the probability of coming out of the pods and really being with someone who y’all’s lives and personalities are just going to mesh perfectly is not huge.” He continued, “It really looks like our biggest issue was this physical aspect, and it wasn’t. Our biggest issue was just compatibility and personality. I’m glad I did it with Zay, but it’s just, that was part of the test of the experiment, seeing if it could work in the real world, and ours just didn’t. So, yes, I know the mistakes that I and she both made that we could change along the way, but that’s life.”</p><p>Cole also explained why he called Zanab “bipolar” in one of their final conversations before their wedding. “Everyone keeps asking me about the bipolar comment and I think that’s why I might have asked it is because she was 1000% ready to marry me in one conversation,” he said. “And then the next she’d be really upset at me for something. And it was like, ‘Wait, how are you 1000% ready to marry me?'” He continued, “So I was confused going into it. Looking back now, I’m glad I didn’t say ‘yes’ because we obviously weren’t ready to get married. But everything in me would’ve wished to get married. I’m jealous of these [other] guys… Look at what they have, that’s what we all wanted.”</p><p>Cole also called Zanab’s breakup speech at their wedding “horrible.” “I didn’t know what to think, and that’s why we didn’t talk for a long time afterwards is because I didn’t know how I was ever going to process that,” he said. “I didn’t want to talk to her because I felt betrayed and I felt like she had really duped me and brought me to that moment to do that to me… I wish we could do it over and have more conversations beforehand.”</p><p>Cole also seemed to confirm he and Zanab aren’t still together when he liked a comment on a <a href=# rel="noopener nofollow">TikTok</a> post in November 2022 that read, “The camping chair is telling me Zanab and you didn’t get married. 😭” The TikTok video saw Cole flexing in his home.</p><p>Before the Love Is Blind season 3 finale aired, fans speculated over Cole and Zanab’s relationship status based on their social media behavior. As of writing this, Cole followed Zanab on Instagram and had liked one of her Instagram posts, though Zanab did not follow him back. There was also a woman’s voice in a <a href=# rel="noopener nofollow">TikTok</a> video Cole posted in September 2022 of him and his dog. “Aww,” the woman said as Cole’s dog jumped up and down as he flexed in the mirror. Cole also seemed to talk to the woman at the end of the video. “It’s just fat rolls,” he said.</p><p>Cole also posted another <a href=# rel="noopener nofollow">TikTok</a> video in February 2022 of a dark-haired woman hiding her face from the camera, though it’s unclear who she is. “What the fuck?” the woman said after Cole sang a random song. That said, there are also clues that Cole and Zanab are not still together after Love Is Blind season 3. The main one was that it didn’t seem like they were living together. Posts of Cole and Zanab’s respective homes show them with noticeably different decor and layouts, such as an <a href=# rel="noopener nofollow">Instagram video</a> Cole posted in September 2022 of him with light-colored dining chairs, while Zanab posted an <a href=# rel="noopener nofollow">Instagram photo</a> in October 2022 of her with dark-colored stools for her dining table. Cole and Zanab also seemed to hint at their relationship status when Zanab posted an <a href=# rel="noopener nofollow">Instagram</a> photo of the moment they met in person on Love Is Blind season 3 for the first time. “Who’s here for our love story? This is one of my favorite memories ❤️ #cozé” she captioned the post. Cole, for his part, posted an <a href=# rel="noopener nofollow">Instagram</a> photo of the moment with the caption, “Put her in a magazine!” Cole also seemed to hint he and Zanab were still on good terms when he posted an <a href=# rel="noopener nofollow">Instagram</a> video of them on a date on Love Is Blind season 3 with the caption: “Verified Too much fun dancing around and eating lobster on the sailboat with @zanabjaffrey . Sunset, incredible. Titanic pose off the bow, spectacular. Not falling in the water, grateful. Feelings and conversations, priceless.”</p><p><span>In an interview with </span><a href=# rel="noopener nofollow">Women’s Health</a><span> after </span>Love Is Blind<span> season 3, Cole revealed that he regretted telling Zanab that he was more attracted Colleen Reed, another contestant on </span>Love Is Blind<span> season 3, than her. He also regretted jokingly asking Colleen’s fiance, Matt Bolton, if he would be open to a “fiancée swap.” “I crossed a line. Like undoubtedly, that was stupid,” Cole said. Zanab added, “ It just should have never came out of Cole’s mouth. And it was a foot-in-a-mouth moment, and hopefully he’s grown from that.” Colleen also told Women’s Health about the “inappropriate” conversation she and Cole had after The Pods.&nbsp;“I see now that how being too nice can be inappropriate, and I’ve apologized immensely to Zanab and to Matt and we’ve all kind of moved well past it,” she said. “And I’ve grown a lot from that. And I apologize to this day that it was at Zanab and Matt’s expense.”</span></p><p><span>Who is Cole from </span>Love Is Blind<span> season 3? Cole is a 27-year-old from Fort Worth, Texas.

In the final episode of the Love Is Blind: After the Altar special in February 2023, Raven revealed that she and SK broke up after he cheated on her. “That really sucks. Since then, a lot has changed. My world is completely different. Because SK cheated on me, and now our relationship is over. It’s so crazy to watch it back and remember my feelings then,” Raven said in a clip recorded on her phone months after she and SK got re-engaged on Love Is Blind: After the Altar.</p><p>She continued, “I was so happy. I really was so invested in the person that everyone saw and everyone loved. That’s the person that I saw and I loved everyday too. So to see everything that has happened since then is so hard. Because that was not the person I thought I was with. I cannot imagine opening up to someone like I opened up to SK. That’s always been my personal challenge and I know it’s a blessing in disguise and I can take that into another relationship. I know in my heart I still believe in love, of course. This is someone I trusted with anything. I still believe in love, and I’m so happy for my friends who have found that. They are my biggest inspiration, and I know it’s coming for me.”</p><p>So who did SK cheat on Raven with after Love Is Blind season 3? In a TikTok video in November 2022, a woman by the TikTok handle <a href=# rel="noopener nofollow">@emmwho9</a> claimed that she went on a date with a Love Is Blind season 3 cast member who was still with his fiance he met on the show. “Put a finger down if you went on a date in April with a guy from Hinge and then you see that he’s actually on the show Love Is Blind, and that he met you after the show was filmed, but is still with the same girl right now,” she said before putting her finger down.</p><p>In another TikTok <a href=# rel="noopener nofollow">video</a>, the user confirmed the cast member was SK. The video included a clip of SK, as well as screenshots of texts from him. “What’s up Em…it’s SK from Hinge,” SK wrote, to which the user responded, “Hello. Hi.” In another text, SK wrote, “I’m honestly ready to plan our ramen date coz I’d date to have to go without you lol. When are u free this week,” to which the user responded, “Emmm can I let you know. I’m having a bad week I’m extremely behind.” In another text, SK complimented the user on a bikini photo she went. “WOOW give me a minute…my phone is too hot to handle at the moment lol. Bathing suit looks fire on you.” The user also included screenshots of Instagram DMs between her and SK, as well as DMs she sent to Raven on Instagram after she learned that she and SK were still together when they went on a date. “I’m guessing you have now seen the video since SK unfollowed me, as you can see the last text he sent me was 4 months ago. I’m so sorry, but if you were together then I am sending you receipts of everything incase you want them,” the user wrote in the DM. She captioned the video, “I didn’t want to do this, but hate to see cheating men get away with it.”</p><p>In a TikTok live at the time, Raven responded to cheating accusations and confirmed she and SK were still together “Rumors are rumors, and we’re fine,” she said. “That’s my man, and I’m sticking beside him.”</p><p>Soon after, another woman by the TikTok handle <a href=# rel="noopener nofollow">@hannahbethstyle</a> posted a video claiming she and SK dated on and off from 2019 to 2022. “It all started in 2019… we became good friends & started dating (bf/gf, attended weddings, birthday celebrations, etc.) Broke up mutually & remained friends,” Hannah wrote in the video, which also included time-stamped texts and photos of her and SK from 2019 to 2022. “We left Ibiza & flew back to Madrid. I asked to see his phone to send pics to myself but ended up seeing messages from a contact name “fiance.” I waited to front him until dinner bc I was trying to wrap my head around what I saw,” Hannah wrote later in the video. She continued, “This is the dinner where I asked about finding a ‘fiance’ in his phone & he told me it was for the LIB show but it was just for $ & they were friends only…I didn’t 100% believe him but he never gave me a reason to not trust him so I just trusted his word & it made sense (at the time).”</p><p>She continued, “I brought my reservations one more time before we flew home and said I should meet raven if this is all fake, and he agreed. I found her on IG, liked her pics & didn’t think anything of it. Until..As we were waiting outside for an Uber, I glance over & see him receive an IG notification from her and the message said, ‘Ummm who this?’ With my profile attached. He says to me: ‘I told you I was going to handle it.’ So I was like that’s weird but ok..” Hannah went on to include texts and photos of her and SK, going on vacation together and planning trips up until September 2022, two months before the Love Is Blind season 3 reunion premiered where SK and Raven confirmed they were back together.</p><p>In a joint statement on their Instagrams in November 2022, Raven and SK confirmed they had broken up after the cheating rumors. “We are saddened to announce that we have decided to go our separate ways,” the statement read “Due to on-going legal proceedings surrounding these allegations, we can not provide additional details and ask that you please respect our privacy during this hard time.” The statement concluded, “Thank you for following our love story and believing in us. This journey has forever shaped our lives and we are so grateful for everyone who has been a part of it. Your love and support means everything.”</p><p>Raven and SK first broke up in episode 10 of Love Is Blind season 3 after SK told Raven “I do not” at the altar at their wedding. “Today Raven, we both know how we feel about each other. I love you. However, we have a very unique and complex set of circumstances. I feel like today is not the best time for us to do this,” SK told Raven after he broke up with her.</p><p>A year and a half after their wedding, Raven and SK revealed they were back together and dating during the Love Is Blind season 3 reunion. “Have you guys talked since then, been out since then, hooked up since then?” host Vanessa Lachey asked SK and Raven, to which Raven responded, “Yes.” Vanessa then asked, “So are y’all dating now,” to which Raven responded, “Yeah.” Raven and SK then got up and kissed in the middle of the room.</p><p>During the reunion, Raven and SK also explained how their relationship works while SK lives in California and Raven still lives in Dallas. “Our communication, I think I can speak for the both of us, we’ve never been on this level in any other relationship,” Raven said. “Every time, we reach a new level. Nothing is perfect, but we’ve grown so much from this experiment, first of all, from what we went through, from being apart, it makes it so much better when we’re together. Of course, I would prefer to be with him every day. But we’ve grown so much from it, and it’s really beautiful to do that.”</p><p>During episode 10 of Love Is Blind season 3, SK explained to producers in an interview after his wedding that he broke up with Raven because of the cultural differences between her and his Nigerian family, as well as her unwillingness to move from Texas to California with him. “It is no question in my mind. I love Raven. I know she’s probably mad and angry, but I just would feel really bad and really guilty to continue on in a marriage with her when I know there are so many other unanswered questions,” he said. “It’s not just about me having to leave after our marriage. It’s about her not being flexible to maybe move to California with me. It’s also about certain things I know for a fact that she’s very strong about. I still have a little bit of an issue with the family situation. I have thought about the risk of losing her forever because of my decision today, but as sad as it sounds, I think I would rather lose her than be in a marriage with her where I will feel a lot of shortcomings from her everyday.”</p><p>In her own interview with producers after the wedding, Raven confirmed she planned on telling SK “I do” before he broke up with her. “I was planning on saying ‘yes’ today,” she said. She also told producers she was confused over why SK broke up with her.&nbsp;“I am not the perfect Nigerian bride and we’ve established that so many times. I don’t know if I can ever be that way just because that’s not who I am,” she said.</p><p>According to SK’s <a href=# rel="noopener nofollow">Linkedin</a>, he’s moved to San Francisco, California, while Raven lists on her <a href=# rel="noopener nofollow">Facebook</a>, Pilates by Raven, that she still lives in Dallas, Texas, where Love Is Blind season 3 filmed. SK’s <a href=# rel="noopener nofollow">Twitter</a> also lists his location as San Francisco. Raven and SK also don’t follow each other on Instagram. SK moved to San Francisco around January 2022 when he took a job as a co-chair of UC Launch in Berkeley, California. “UC LAUNCH is University of California’s leading accelerator program that guides startups from prototype to pitch.

Still, SK and Raven seem to be on good terms at least.

The answer is yes. Colleen and Matt were one of two couples who said “I do” at the altar of their wedding day in episode 11 of Love Is Blind season 3. The other couple was Alexa Alfia and Brennon Lemieux. Colleen and Matt confirmed they were still together in the Love Is Blind season 3 “After the Altar” special in February 2023.</p><p>Colleen and Matt married on July 2, 2021, according to the marriage license filed in the County of Dallas, Texas. The license listed Colleen Bridget Reed as applicant one, and Matthew Ray Bolton as applicant two. The license was recorded on July 16, 2021, and seemed to confirm Colleen and Matt married in the Love Is Blind season 3 finale three days after Alexa and Brennon, who married on June 30, 2021. TikTok user @<a href=# rel="noopener nofollow">broopitt</a> also confirmed Colleen and Matt were still together in November 2022 when they posted two videos of them shopping at Target. “Think it’s safe to say Colleen and Matt got married,” the user wrote over the video. “You allowed me to break out of my shell. You allowed me to become vulnerable again. I was in a bad way before all of this, from a relationship standpoint.The comfort level you gave me and just allowing me to become vulnerable again, it speaks volumes. I love you to death. Absolutely, I do. I want to marry you,” Matt told Colleen at the altar of their wedding.</p><p>Colleen and Matt confirmed they were still together and married in the Love Is Blind season 3 reunion. They also revealed at the time that they weren’t living together, but planned to move in together a few months after the reunion filmed. “Logistics-wise and money-wise, we weren’t there. As soon as the wedding, the next day, we weren’t money-wise ready to give up on our leases,” Colleen said. “It’s a very complicated situation. We got married in an unorthodox way, so we’re doing marriage in an unorthodox way.” She continued, “We have a plan in a couple months. We made sure our leases line up in the same amount of time, and we are going to move in together. I can’t wait to move in with him, and I’m going to spend the rest of my life with him. So I’m content. We are content. We are on the same page with how we’re doing things.”</p><p>Colleen and Matt also told <a href=# rel="noopener nofollow">People</a> at the time about what their relationship has been like since they married in July 2021. “You learn a lot. Getting out of the show and the whole atmosphere, you learn a lot about each other,” Matt said. “It kind of started off rough right when we got out of it… in the sense of knowing that you just got married. So now you’ve got to take your schedule and incorporate her scheduling. You’ve got to blend them together.” He continued, “And if you have certain things you like to do on the weekends, sometimes you can’t do them anymore. So just learning how to kind of mesh like that was tough at the very beginning… it’s just learning how to incorporate each other into your daily lives. But at this point, we’re as good as we’ve ever been.”</p><p>Before the Love Is Blind season 3 finale aired, fans speculated over Colleen and Matt’s relationship status based on their social media behavior. Colleen and Matt didn’t follow each other on Instagram and hadn’t liked any of each other’s posts. However, they were friends on Venmo, though Matt’s Venmo transactions are private. Colleen, however, was still friends with many contestants from Love Is Blind season 3, including Raven Ross and Alexa Alfia. She had several transactions between the women around the time they took a girls’ trip to Scottsdale, Arizona, for a girl’s trip that seemed to be Alexa’s second Bachelorette party.</p><p>In an interview with <a href=# rel="noopener nofollow">Women’s Health</a> after Love Is Blind season 3, Colleen apologized for a conversation she had with another contestant, Cole Barnett, about how Colleen was more his type than his fiance, Zanab Jaffrey. “Cole definitely crossed a line in opening that up,” she said. “I don’t think it would have ever been discussed if he wouldn’t have kind of started that conversation.” She continued, “I see now how being too nice can be inappropriate, and I’ve apologized immensely to Zanab and to Matt, and we’ve all kind of moved well past it. And I’ve grown a lot from that. And I apologize to this day that it was at Zanab and Matt’s expense.” Matt also told the magazine about how he felt Cole was out of line for the comment but Colleen’s decision to tell him about it made his “trust factor” in her increase. In the interview, Matt also apologized for how he reacted after Colleen revealed that she told Cole “he was a cut guy.” “I kind of wish I could go back a little bit and not have run away so quickly, right after something like that it happened, because she did come to me and explain it all,” Matt said. “I don’t think I handled it the best. I think it was just fine to be upset at the comment. But like I said, I wish I could have handled a little better.”</p><p>Colleen also explained to People how she and Matt recovered after her conversation with Cole. “With me and Matt, there was never any trust issues. With the whole Cole situation, there was more that was said in terms of me saying, ‘There’s a reason why me and Cole didn’t work out, there’s a reason why me and Matt are together, and there’s a reason why Cole and Zanab were together,'” she said. She continued, “I tried to explain that to Matt, but that was one of my challenges is communicating in conflict and it got messed up and then it turned into a game of telephone. So it was more about how we deal with conflict and how I gain a backbone and shut things down then be too nice than trust for us.”</p><p>She also added that, while she wouldn’t change anything about her relationship with Matt, she wished she would’ve handled her conversation with Cole in a different way.&nbsp;“Everything happens for a reason and me and Matt found each other, so I don’t wish that I did anything differently with Matt,” she said. “We were very transparent with each other and I’m proud of us for being so open and honest.” She continued, “The only thing would be definitely shutting down that conversation with Cole in the pool because I love [Zanab] so much. So yeah, I wish I would do that conversation differently.”</p><p>Matt also explained to People in November 2022 why he told Colleen “I do” on their wedding day. “Obviously there were a lot of conversations that you guys didn’t see,” he said. “Going through those, I’m glad that we did go through those little stir-ups though because it allowed us to learn how we handle certain things.” He continued, “If I could take anything back, it would be not run away from that stuff. That was something that we kind of came to — ‘Don’t run away when something happens’ — and I felt like I was kind of looking for an out.</p><p>Matt also responded to viewers who questioned why he and Colleen married given the up and down nature of their relationship in the lead up to their wedding. <span>“Leading up to it, even after the aquarium scene, we had a lot of conversations that you guys didn’t see, about if we really wanted to do this, and we knew we loved each other. We saw so much potential, and it was just on the day of, we still didn’t know,” he said. “But when I saw her walking down the aisle, I was like, ‘Listen, we’ve got too much potential. This is such a great moment. We are meant for each other.’ So we just had to do it. Can’t pass it up.” Colleen also told People that she and Matt were “so in love” but “we were having conflicts and that’s what I was questioning, ‘Is love enough?'” She continued, “You see me toy with that question throughout the season, and same thing with him. We knew that we had these immense feelings for each other, but marriage is a very serious thing and we’re not taking this lightly… we were just going with how we felt and with our gut feeling. And at the end of the day, yes, love is enough for me and Matt. And as soon as I saw him crying and snorting down the aisle, I knew that that was my person.”</span></p><p><span>Who is Colleen from </span>Love Is Blind<span> season 3?

Love Is Blind season 1 was filmed in Atlanta, Georgia, while season 2 was filmed in Chicago, Illinois. In an interview with <a href=# rel="noopener nofollow">Entertainment Tonight</a> in 2020, Love Is Blind creator Chris Coelen explained that each season casts contestants from the same city so long distance isn’t a factor in their relationships. “It was a really interesting and diverse cast in terms of the fact that they were all from many different places originally,” he said. “But they were all living around the Atlanta area [at the time of casting]. The reason that we did that was because we wanted to give these people a real shot at making their relationships work for the long term.”</p><p>He continued, “Whether you think [love] is going to happen or not, we wanted people that would be ready to be married. If you’re really in it—genuinely in it, which was the No. 1 casting criteria—it felt to us that it was too much of a bridge for someone living in Miami and someone living in Seattle to build. We thought let’s at least start with them in the same geographical area.”</p><p>Coelen also explained to <a href=# rel=noopener>Variety</a> in 2020 about why he wanted each Love Is Blind season to cast contestants from the same city. “We wanted people to all be living, currently in the same place. It’s too difficult if you’re from Tampa and they’re from Portland, that just throws another wrench in. We wanted to give them a real shot at making their love and their marriage working,” he said. Coelen also told Variety at the time about the locations he was looking at for future Love Is Blind seasons. “Look, the idea is that ultimately we’re going to do this in other countries—it’s very global. There’s lots of places that that we could take it. Chicago is a great place to look at, so is New York, Boston, Houston. There’s so many different places that we could go. And like I said, outside of the country as well,” he said.</p><p>Coelen also told <a href=# rel="noopener nofollow">Oprah</a> magazine in 2020 that The Pods lasted around 10 days, which started with a series of speed dates between contestants that lasted between eight to 12 minutes. We did a ranking system, from who you though was most compatible to least compatible after the first date. Every day, the list got shorter and shorter,” Love Is Blind season 1 contestant Mark Cuevas told Oprah magazine at the time. Coelen also told Oprah magazine made the cast smaller a few days into the The Pods stage to focus on the contestants forming “real connections.” “We ended up focusing on people who were really forming real connections,” he said.</p><p>Though the dates started short, Coelen told Variety that the producers allowed contestants to have longer dates once they saw how strong their connections were. “In the beginning nobody knew who anybody was. So we structured it so that they would have an opportunity to talk to everyone. They were never given any instruction on what to say or what not to say or what they could ask about or what they couldn’t ask about. And you see on the show, some people decided to [ask] ‘How tall are you, what do you look like?'” he said. “Other people were like, ‘Why would I ever do that? That’s not the point of this.’ We really wanted it to be their own story, their own journey. We would set it up so they had the opportunity to talk to everybody. Then from that point [it was monitored]. Let’s say somebody really wanted to talk to you and you’re like, ‘Yeah, I have no interest in that person.'”</p><p>He continued, “You’re not going to talk to them. It doesn’t matter. We’re not going to arrange people to speak to one another where somebody’s like, ‘yeah, I don’t want to talk to that person.’ We just wouldn’t do that. Multiple points throughout the day we had to break and they had to eat, go to the bathroom, go do interviews, but generally we wanted to give them as much time in the pods as possible with the people that they genuinely wanted to talk to. These dates are obviously cut down but they were hours and hours and hours long.”</p><h2>Who are the Love Is Blind season 3 hosts?</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/stylecaster.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/10/Nick-Vanessa-Lachey-Love-Is-Blind.png><p>The Love Is Blind season 3 hosts are Nick Lachey and Vanessa Lachey, who have hosted the series since it premiered in February 2020. The couple also hosted season 1 of Netflix’s The Ultimatum. Nick was the lead singer of the boy band 98 Degrees from 1996 to 2012. The group reunited in 2012 and are still together. Nick has also released four solo alums: SoulO, What’s Left of Me, A Father’s Lullaby and Soundtrack of My Life. He was married to Jessica Simpson from 2002 to 2006, and the two also starred in their own reality show, Newlyweds: Nick and Jessica on MTV, from 2003 to 2005. Nick is also the winner of season 5 of The Masked Singer&nbsp;during which he performed as the character “Piglet.” Vanessa was the 1998 Miss Teen USA and was a correspondent for Entertainment Tonight and Total Request Live on MTV. She’s the current lead in CBS’ NCIS spinoff, NCIS: Hawai’i, which premiered in 2021.</p><p>In an interview with <a href=# rel="noopener nofollow">Distractify</a> in March 2022, Nick explained that he and Vanessa wanted to host Love Is Blind because of how their own relationship was long distance when they first started dating. “When Netflix approached us with Love is Blind all those years ago, we jumped at the opportunity because the show really spoke to us personally,” Nick said. “When we first started dating, Vanessa was in New York and I was in Los Angeles. We didn’t get to see each other a lot so we had a lot of long phone conversations, learning everything we possibly could about each other.” He continued, “[Those conversations were] really important for building our relationship and knowing we wanted the same things before there were external pressures on the relationship.” Nick also told Distractify that he and Vanessa want contestants to “fall in love for the right reasons and then introduce everything else.”</p><p>Nick also told <a href=# rel="noopener nofollow">People</a> in 2022 about how he thinks Love Is Blind would’ve worked for him and Vanessa if they had met in The Pods.&nbsp;“We’ve thought about that, often. And I really, I’m not just saying this for the benefit of this show, I think we would’ve,” he said. “We have the same birthday, we have the same passions, we have the same interests, we have the same drive. Things that motivated us.” Vanessa asked “You would’ve found me through a wall?” to which Nick responded, “I would find you anywhere.” He continued, “I really do think we would’ve found each other. I think we would’ve gravitated to each other. That’s what we did in life. Obviously, we knew each other.” Vanessa added, “We did. We had to find our journey to get to each other.”</p><p>Nick also claimed to <a href=# rel="noopener nofollow">Us <span>Weekly</span></a><span>&nbsp;in 2022 that he would’ve joined Love Is Blind if he was single. “I would. I mean, it’s fascinating,” he said. “Especially having seen the success of season 1 and seeing two loving couples still married to this day? If I watched that and I was looking for love, why wouldn’t you wanna be a part of that? You know, it’s proven to work!” He added, </span>“This dating world is not one I ever was part of — this very superficial ‘swipe left.’ There’s so much judgment and you can Google everybody. I’m not from that era.”</p><p>Love Is Blind season 3 is available to stream on Netflix.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/stylecaster.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/02/Leap-of-Faith-Cameron-Hamilton-Lauren-Speed.jpeg><p><span class="_text_y7yck_1 _text_153t8_1" data-component=text data-alias data-alignment data-theme=product-price data-transform data-truncate>$15.89</span><span class="_text_y7yck_1 _text_153t8_1" data-component=text data-alias=buy-now__original-price data-alignment data-theme=product-price-strikethrough data-transform data-truncate>$28.00</span><span class="_text_y7yck_1 _text_153t8_1" data-component=text data-alias data-alignment data-theme=product-percentage-off data-transform data-truncate>43% Off</span></p><p><span class=s1>For more about Love Is Blind, read Cameron Hamilton and Lauren Speed’s 2021 book,<a href=# rel=nofollow><span class=s2><i> Leap of Faith: Finding Love the Modern Way</i></span></a></span><span class=s3><i>. </i></span><span class=s1>In the book, Cameron and Lauren, who were one of two couples to marry from <i>Love Is Blind</i> season 1, share their “engaging and accessible love advice for the modern world” and reveal exclusive behind-the-scenes details from the Netflix series and what went down in The Pods that viewers didn’t see.
