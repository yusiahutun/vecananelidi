The first thing Boyer said to him was: 'What b**** are you here about?'</span><br></p><p><span>Mr Locklair confronted Boyer earlier this month about the death of 34-year-old Michelle Haggadone.</span><br></p><p><span>Her body was found in April 2000 beneath pine straw at a parking area on Interstate 20 near Florence, about 30 miles from the truck stop where Boyer had picked her up.</span><br></p><p><span>Boyer immediately denied killing Ms Haggadone, lashing out at Mr Locklair and an investigator with him.</span><br></p><p><span>'He said he had slept with a lot of prostitutes and a lot of them were detectives' daughters or prosecutors' daughters,' Mr Locklair said. 'He just tried to get the upper hand from the start.'</span><br></p><p><span>The captain added: 'I'm not a behaviour science expert, but he has some deep, deep issues with women.'</span><br></p><p><span>Ms Haggadone was strangled with a wire or cord after the two argued over the price of her services, authorities said.</span><br></p><p><span>Her body went unidentified for a decade, until a DNA sample from a relatives matched a sample from her body.</span><br></p><p><span>Investigators had no DNA evidence to go on, but Locklair and another investigator realised several aspects of the crime, like what the victim was doing and where and how she was killed, matched the earlier slayings linked to Boyer.</span><br></p><p><span>Without physical evidence to back him into a corner, Mr Locklair decided he would try to draw a confession by gaining Boyer's trust. He told Boyer about his father, who also was a truck driver, then started trapping him in his lies.</span><br></p><p><span>Mr Locklair's case and the one in Tennessee will take some time to resolve. Boyer will be taken to Tennessee to face a first-degree murder charge after his North Carolina sentence ends.</span><br></p><p><span>He is going to face a murder charge in South Carolina, but Mr Locklair isn't sure when he might end up in court because of the other two cases.</span><br></p><img src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/i.dailymail.co.uk/i/pix/2011/09/19/article-2038984-0DF84BC800000578-40_468x286.jpg height=286 width=468 alt="In jail: Boyer is serving a sentence of up to 12 years in prison after pleading guilty in 2007 to the second-degree murder of Scarlett Wood" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto><p class=imageCaption>In jail: Boyer is serving a sentence of up to 12 years in prison after pleading guilty in 2007 to the second-degree murder of Scarlett Wood</p><p><span>Boyer is serving a sentence of up to 12 years in a North Carolina prison after pleading guilty in 2007 to second-degree murder for killing Scarlett Wood in Wilmington four years earlier.</span><br></p><p><span>Boyer said he was doing drugs with the 31-year-old prostitute when they had an argument, he pushed her, and she struck her head on furniture, authorities said.</span><br></p><p><span>But an autopsy found Wood suffered broken ribs and facial bones, and her pelvic bones showed signs of a stabbing.</span><br></p><p><span>Boyer had been interviewed when Wood was still considered a missing person case because the two had been seen together at a party the night she disappeared.</span><br></p><p><span>Authorities said detectives later got incriminating statements from Boyer when the case became a homicide investigation.</span><br></p><p><span>Boyer is a prime suspect in the death of 26-year-old Rose Marie Mallette, who was reported missing in 2001, said New Hanover County Sheriff's Detective Ken Murphy, a cold case investigator in Wilmington.</span><br></p><p><span>The reported prostitute's remains were found wrapped in a blanket in an industrial area of the city a year later, the back of her skull crushed.</span><br></p><p><span>Boyer also seemed to target women who were especially small. For instance, Ms Haggadone's family said she likely weighed less than 100lbs when she was killed, while Boyer was 5'7" and 293lbs when he entered the North Carolina prison system in 2007.</span><br></p><p><span>Mr Locklair said Boyer could be responsible for several more deaths because of his transient life as a trucker and his short temper when women disagree with him, a suspicion shared by a woman who searches for missing people.</span><br></p><p><span>Monica Caison, founder of Community United Effort Center for Missing Persons in Wilmington, said investigators need to look at three cases where women disappeared over five months in 1995 in Brunswick County, North Carolina, just west of Wilmington.</span><br></p><p><span>'We have a lot of unsolved missing persons in the general area where Mr Boyer was known to frequent, live, and be. So, to me that alone warrants a second look,' Ms Caison said.</span><br></p><p><span>At least two of the unsolved cases involve woman who were small and slightly built, like Boyer's other alleged victims.</span><br></p><p><span>Cold case investigators in the area are aware of Ms Caison's concerns and are checking their files for any links to Boyer.</span><br></p><p><span>Ms Haggadone's family came back to South Carolina last week as authorities announced her identification and Boyer's confession.</span><br><span>Her sister, Tuesday Miller, said she felt a cold presence when she went to the lonely parking area where she died.</span><br></p><p><span>'I am very overwhelmed. There are other people going through this same exact thing by this same exact guy,' Ms Miller said. 'That's just sick. He's just evil.'</span></p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7pa3IpbCmmZmhe6S7ja6iaKaVrMBwrdGtoJyklWJ%2FcX%2BXcm9tZ3qkta95oaiwnqpdgbyvs4yhmK6kXam%2Ftq%2FKnqlmq5WntqK4jKSgpaSVp3quwdGdnKudlGK9s7vSraCtraSawG6hsmefraWc</p><h4><i class="fas fa-share-alt" aria-hidden=true></i>&nbsp;Share!</h4><ul class=share-buttons><li><a href="https://www.facebook.com/sharer/sharer.php?u=%2fjohn-boyer-long-haul-trucker-serial-killer-murdered-prostitutes-us-html.html" target=_blank title="Share on Facebook"><i class="fab fa-facebook" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Share on Facebook</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="https://twitter.com/intent/tweet?source=%2fjohn-boyer-long-haul-trucker-serial-killer-murdered-prostitutes-us-html.html" target=_blank title=Tweet><i class="fab fa-twitter" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Tweet</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="https://plus.google.com/share?url=%2fjohn-boyer-long-haul-trucker-serial-killer-murdered-prostitutes-us-html.html" target=_blank title="Share on Google+"><i class="fab fa-google-plus" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Share on Google+</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="http://www.tumblr.com/share?v=3&u=%2fjohn-boyer-long-haul-trucker-serial-killer-murdered-prostitutes-us-html.html" target=_blank title="Post to Tumblr"><i class="fab fa-tumblr" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Post to Tumblr</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="http://pinterest.com/pin/create/button/?url=%2fjohn-boyer-long-haul-trucker-serial-killer-murdered-prostitutes-us-html.html" target=_blank title="Pin it"><i class="fab fa-pinterest-p" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Pin it</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="http://www.reddit.com/submit?url=%2fjohn-boyer-long-haul-trucker-serial-killer-murdered-prostitutes-us-html.html" target=_blank title="Submit to Reddit"><i class="fab fa-reddit-alien" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Submit to Reddit</span></a></li></ul><style>ul.share-buttons{list-style:none;padding:0}ul.share-buttons li{display:inline}ul.share-buttons .sr-only{position:absolute;clip:rect(1px 1px 1px 1px);clip:rect(1px,1px,1px,1px);padding:0;border:0;height:1px;width:1px;overflow:hidden}</style><div class="prev-next-post pure-g"><div class=pure-u-1-24 style=text-align:left><a href=./kendall-jenner-corseted-orange-croc-trench-coat-bottega-veneta.html><i class="fa fa-chevron-left"></i></a></div><div class=pure-u-10-24><nav class=prev><a href=./kendall-jenner-corseted-orange-croc-trench-coat-bottega-veneta.html>Kendall Jenner's Corseted Croc-Embossed Trench Coat Is the Statement Outerwear You Need This Fall</a></nav></div><div class=pure-u-2-24>&nbsp;</div><div class=pure-u-10-24><nav class=next><a href=./jax-taylor-and-brittany-cartwright-married.html>Jax Taylor and Brittany Cartwright: MARRIED!</a></nav></div><div class=pure-u-1-24 style=text-align:right><a href=./jax-taylor-and-brittany-cartwright-married.html><i class="fa fa-chevron-right"></i></a></div></div></div></div></div><script src=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/blackburn/js/ui.js></script>
