Before meeting her, Chris was drowning with drug abuse and alcohol due to the pain of losing his beloved woman.</p><p>Nonetheless, Chris got enormous happiness in his life after marrying his second wife, Venessa Villaneuva. Especially when they gave birth to their children, Chris had a reason to improve his lifestyle.</p><h2><strong>Chris Pérez’s Daughter from Venessa Villaneuva.</strong></h2><p>Venessa Villaneuva is a Mexican-American actress famous for her role in Memphis Rising: Elvis Returns.</p><p>Chris and Venessa met each other around 1996. They started dating in 1998. Finally, Venessa and Chris tied the knot in 2001. However, their short-lived marriage ended in 2008.</p><p>During their married life, Chris and Venessa gave birth to two children. They are Cassie Perez and Noah Perez.</p><h2><strong>Chris Pérez’s Daughter, Cassie Perez </strong>Age, and Wiki</h2><p>Cassie Perez is the first child of Chris and Venessa. The couple conceived their daughter before even tying the knot. Cassie’s date of birth is on December 23, 1998. As of 2021, she is 22 years old.

For Chris, his daughter is the source of motivation and hope.</p><h2><strong>Education and Career.</strong></h2><p>Cassie completed her schooling in Texas. After completing her education, she joined Del Mar College in Corpus Christi.</p><p>Cassie has no interest in pursuing her father’s career in music. Instead, this 22-year-old has strong aspirations to become an entrepreneur in the health and beauty sector. Her mother is also one of the beautiful actresses in the film industry. Hence, Cassie’s mother is her role model.</p><p>At the moment, she is working as Medical Aesthetician at <a href=#>Massage Envy</a>. One day, Cassie plans to run her spa. Apart from that, she is also a budding entrepreneur. She runs her own small business and projects. One of the projects Cassie is involved in is <a href=#>Ethereal Beauty.</a></p><h2><strong>Cassie Perez Boyfriend</strong></h2><p>Cassie is quick to find a lover for herself.

They named it Saint.</p><p>Cassie does not hide her boyfriend from her parents. Furthermore, both Cassie’s and Mark’s parents are supportive of their relationship. Also, Cassie posts a ton of pictures of her and Mark on social media.</p><h2><strong>Chris Pérez’s Daughter, Noah Pérez.</strong></h2><p>Cassie has a brother named Noah. He is also the second and youngest child in the Perez family, born on April 5, 2005. Hence, he is 16 years old at the moment. Just like his elder sister, Noah grew up in Corpus Christi.</p><p>Unfortunately, Noah was born with Down Syndrome. Noah is also close with both his father and mother. He is interested in music and takes piano classes also. The youngest child of Chris and Venessa is 5 feet tall.</p><p>Currently, he is studying in school. Since Noah is interested in music, he might follow in his father’s footsteps in the future. But at the moment, Noah Perez is too young to take the decision.</p><img aria-describedby=caption-attachment-2347 decoding=async src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/famous-celebrities.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/Chris-Perez-with-his-son-Noah.jpg alt="Image of Mexican guitarist, Chris Perez with his son Noah" width=600 height=400 sizes="(max-width: 600px) 100vw, 600px" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto><p id=caption-attachment-2347 class=wp-caption-text>A professional guitarist and songwriter, Chris Perez with his son Noah</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmiekaK8tr%2BMnJylnZKntrW1xKxlnKedZLCpvsisZKmdoprHtHnDmqygoKSav26vwKyqop1dpbKzsdlmmKecXZmutrPHrZyrZZ6krql5z56pnrJf</p><h4><i class="fas fa-share-alt" aria-hidden=true></i>&nbsp;Share!</h4><ul class=share-buttons><li><a href="https://www.facebook.com/sharer/sharer.php?u=%2fchris-perezs-daughter-cassie-perez-and-daughter-noah-perez.html" target=_blank title="Share on Facebook"><i class="fab fa-facebook" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Share on Facebook</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="https://twitter.com/intent/tweet?source=%2fchris-perezs-daughter-cassie-perez-and-daughter-noah-perez.html" target=_blank title=Tweet><i class="fab fa-twitter" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Tweet</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="https://plus.google.com/share?url=%2fchris-perezs-daughter-cassie-perez-and-daughter-noah-perez.html" target=_blank title="Share on Google+"><i class="fab fa-google-plus" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Share on Google+</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="http://www.tumblr.com/share?v=3&u=%2fchris-perezs-daughter-cassie-perez-and-daughter-noah-perez.html" target=_blank title="Post to Tumblr"><i class="fab fa-tumblr" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Post to Tumblr</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="http://pinterest.com/pin/create/button/?url=%2fchris-perezs-daughter-cassie-perez-and-daughter-noah-perez.html" target=_blank title="Pin it"><i class="fab fa-pinterest-p" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Pin it</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="http://www.reddit.com/submit?url=%2fchris-perezs-daughter-cassie-perez-and-daughter-noah-perez.html" target=_blank title="Submit to Reddit"><i class="fab fa-reddit-alien" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Submit to Reddit</span></a></li></ul><style>ul.share-buttons{list-style:none;padding:0}ul.share-buttons li{display:inline}ul.share-buttons .sr-only{position:absolute;clip:rect(1px 1px 1px 1px);clip:rect(1px,1px,1px,1px);padding:0;border:0;height:1px;width:1px;overflow:hidden}</style><div class="prev-next-post pure-g"><div class=pure-u-1-24 style=text-align:left><a href=./curiosity-killed-cat-ben-volpeliere-17241201.html><i class="fa fa-chevron-left"></i></a></div><div class=pure-u-10-24><nav class=prev><a href=./curiosity-killed-cat-ben-volpeliere-17241201.html>Curiosity Killed The Cat's Ben Volpeliere-Pierrot: People give me a hard time</a></nav></div><div class=pure-u-2-24>&nbsp;</div><div class=pure-u-10-24><nav class=next><a href=./marshawn-lynch-smacks-phone-spits.html>Marshawn Lynch Smacks Phone from Fan at LAX, Spits</a></nav></div><div class=pure-u-1-24 style=text-align:right><a href=./marshawn-lynch-smacks-phone-spits.html><i class="fa fa-chevron-right"></i></a></div></div></div></div></div><script src=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/blackburn/js/ui.js></script>
