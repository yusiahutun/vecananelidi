People branded the <a href=#>music</a> star “too old” and said she didn’t “look good.” While people are entitled to their opinions, I’m not sure they realize how damaging those beliefs are.</p><figure class="wp-block-grvmedia-grv-video GRVMultiVideo"></figure><p>After her NFL performance on November 23, people were very quick to express their disapproval of her outfit choice and overall set on X, formerly <a href=#>Twitter</a>.</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading id=h-dolly-parton-s-sister-defended-her-nfl-outfit-rightly-so>Dolly Parton’s sister defended her NFL outfit – rightly so</h2><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-rich is-provider-twitter wp-block-embed-twitter"><p lang=en dir=ltr>77-year-old women shouldn't be on stage pretending they're 20.

She penned: “I personally thought my big sister Dolly was cute as hell in her Dallas Cowboys cheerleading costume at the halftime show on Thanksgiving.</p><p>“To those of you being so critical of a 77-year-old kicking up her heels, I say f*** yourself.

For those 60 and older, it was eight and 12 percent for women and men respectively.</p><p>But it still isn’t enough. The entertainment industry is failing older women and something needs to change – enough women, such as<a href=#> Oprah Winfrey</a>, Emma Thompson, <a href=#>Beyoncé</a>, and Kylie Minogue have had their say on aging and how it affects not only women’s careers but their self-esteem.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/cdn1.celebritytidbit.com/uploads/39/2023/11/GettyImages-1810904374-1024x683.jpg><p>Talking about having a number one single at the age of 55, Kylie Minogue <a href=# rel=nofollow>told</a> People: “I remember a few years ago being in a lot of interview situations where I would be asked: “What age do you think it is still OK to be in pop music, or to be sexy in pop?” It was really awkward, and I felt like I had to justify my presence there.</p><p>“I’m really proud to be representing this moment, and guess what? The earth didn’t cave in, and everyone’s having a great time. This is the age I am. What can I do?”</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading id=h-dolly-parton-turned-down-the-nfl-show-multiple-times-and-now-this-happened>Dolly Parton turned down the NFL show multiple times and now this happened</h2><p>Oprah said while appearing on The Checkup with Dr. David Agus: “The whole culture is set up to tell you that the thing that is most natural – we’re surrounded by these beautiful trees here that literally get better with age. I think we all get better with age – the culture is set up to tell us, in our particular society, that it’s the wrong thing.”</p><p>Oprah makes a great point because the amount of times I’ve heard or read that an older male celebrity has “aged like fine wine” is ridiculous. You never really hear that about a woman; she instead only “ages gracefully” and is praised in a way that will make other women who are a similar age feel awful. Or, like in Emma Thompson’s case where she was told that she was “too old” for Hugh Grant when they appeared in the 1995 adaptation of Sense and Sensibility … she is only a year older than him.</p><p>It is truly maddening.</p><p>Dolly had never done a halftime show even though she’d been asked numerous times as <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">she didn’t think she was “big enough”</a> and now her great NFL performance has been overshadowed by people’s malicious comments about her outfit.</p><p>The entertainment industry should do better, but I don’t think it can improve in leaps and bounds until we as a society decide to first.</p><p><strong>MORE: <a href=#>Taylor Swift praised for incredible gesture towards family of superfan who died</a></strong></p><p>Related Topics</p><p>MORE CELEBRITY STORIES</p><span></span><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7pLHLnpmroaSuwaqwwaKrZ5ufonxzfJFsZmppX2eGcLvPoqWip55isbC4y7JkqZmiqbyvv4ynnaVln6rBp7XTZpueq5Wnw6a%2FjJucrayVp3qjwdNmoK2rXZ%2FCtMCMrZ%2BeZaSevW67xWaroZ1dnrCmrsSrnmg%3D</p><h4><i class="fas fa-share-alt" aria-hidden=true></i>&nbsp;Share!</h4><ul class=share-buttons><li><a href="https://www.facebook.com/sharer/sharer.php?u=%2fopinion-dolly-partons-nfl-outfit-deserves-better-but-its-just-the-tip-of-the-iceberg.html" target=_blank title="Share on Facebook"><i class="fab fa-facebook" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Share on Facebook</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="https://twitter.com/intent/tweet?source=%2fopinion-dolly-partons-nfl-outfit-deserves-better-but-its-just-the-tip-of-the-iceberg.html" target=_blank title=Tweet><i class="fab fa-twitter" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Tweet</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="https://plus.google.com/share?url=%2fopinion-dolly-partons-nfl-outfit-deserves-better-but-its-just-the-tip-of-the-iceberg.html" target=_blank title="Share on Google+"><i class="fab fa-google-plus" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Share on Google+</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="http://www.tumblr.com/share?v=3&u=%2fopinion-dolly-partons-nfl-outfit-deserves-better-but-its-just-the-tip-of-the-iceberg.html" target=_blank title="Post to Tumblr"><i class="fab fa-tumblr" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Post to Tumblr</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="http://pinterest.com/pin/create/button/?url=%2fopinion-dolly-partons-nfl-outfit-deserves-better-but-its-just-the-tip-of-the-iceberg.html" target=_blank title="Pin it"><i class="fab fa-pinterest-p" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Pin it</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="http://www.reddit.com/submit?url=%2fopinion-dolly-partons-nfl-outfit-deserves-better-but-its-just-the-tip-of-the-iceberg.html" target=_blank title="Submit to Reddit"><i class="fab fa-reddit-alien" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Submit to Reddit</span></a></li></ul><style>ul.share-buttons{list-style:none;padding:0}ul.share-buttons li{display:inline}ul.share-buttons .sr-only{position:absolute;clip:rect(1px 1px 1px 1px);clip:rect(1px,1px,1px,1px);padding:0;border:0;height:1px;width:1px;overflow:hidden}</style><div class="prev-next-post pure-g"><div class=pure-u-1-24 style=text-align:left><a href=./544725-thee-pluto-recalls-felicity-move-day-pregnant-ndivyo-nilioa.html><i class="fa fa-chevron-left"></i></a></div><div class=pure-u-10-24><nav class=prev><a href=./544725-thee-pluto-recalls-felicity-move-day-pregnant-ndivyo-nilioa.html>Thee Pluto Recalls Asking Felicity to Move in Day He Found out She Was Pregnant: &amp;quot;Ndivyo Nilioa&amp;quot;</a></nav></div><div class=pure-u-2-24>&nbsp;</div><div class=pure-u-10-24><nav class=next><a href=./sinqua-walls-girlfriend-dating-gay-height-family-parents-html.html>Lucky Man!
