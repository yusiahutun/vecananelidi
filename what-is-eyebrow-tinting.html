Read on for everything you need to know about the process.<br></p><h2 data-node-id title="What is eyebrow tinting? " data-anchor-id=what-is-eyebrow-tinting class="body-h2 css-p3fpzg emt9r7s1">What is eyebrow tinting?</h2><p id=What-Is-Eyebrow-Tinting data-journey-content=true data-node-id=5 class="body-text css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">Eyebrow tinting is the process of applying semi-permanent dye to enhance, shape, darken, and define your brows. Darkening the tiny, fine hairs in and around your eyebrows helps create the illusion of thicker, fuller, and longer brows. “Tinting allows a professional to manipulate the brow area by darkening the fine hairs that surround the perimeter of the brow to increase the width,” says Sacks. “It also allows the specialist to darken the fine hairs in the inner core of the brow that are in less dense areas. This creates a longer brow line (brow tail) or fuller front and a more ideal shape.”</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=7 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">As for the color, she further explains that the tint is made of semi-permanent vegetable dye or henna that is mixed to match your existing shade. This can be done at salons or with at-home kits. “It gives the appearance of thicker, more youthful-looking brows,” adds Tummala. “We’re not making brows darker, we’re just matching your natural color.”</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=8 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">With that said, brow tinting will only accentuate your existing brow hairs—it won’t fill in gaps, spots, or sparse areas. So although brow tinting will certainly help beef up the look of your brows, you may still need to fill in target areas with a brow styler like a tinted wax or gel.</p><h2 data-node-id title="How long does it take to complete?" data-anchor-id=how-long-does-it-take-to-complete class="body-h2 css-p3fpzg emt9r7s1">How long does it take to complete?</h2><p id=How-Long-Does-it-Take data-journey-content=true data-node-id=10 class="body-text css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">An average session, which Saks says can cost anywhere from $35 to $40, takes only about 15 minutes. However, the duration of the service can vary depending on the type of brows you have (coarser brow hairs mean the dye will need to sit for longer) and the type of business you visit. For instance, you’ll probably be in and out at a brow bar, whereas a full-service salon or spa may take longer.</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=11 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">Here’s what the process looks like: First, you'll consult with a specialist to discuss how full and natural you want your brows to look. Then the specialist will prep the area, cleaning the brows and applying a thin layer of petroleum jelly around them to prevent any accidental skin staining. The dye is then mixed and carefully applied, first in the direction of how your brow hairs grow and then a second layer is applied in the opposite direction.</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=12 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">Dye is left on for a few minutes to attain optimal color, then any excess is removed with a damp paper towel. Don't worry if you see dye on the skin underneath your brows after your treatment: Tummala says that it will wash away after a day or two. Even so, it might be a good idea to schedule your first appointment on a Friday, so you can monitor the results over the weekend.</p><h2 data-node-id title="Who is eyebrow tinting best for?" data-anchor-id=who-is-eyebrow-tinting-best-for class="body-h2 css-p3fpzg emt9r7s1">Who is eyebrow tinting best for?</h2><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=14 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">Eyebrow tinting works on all brow types and brow colors. If you’re trying to tint grey or white hair though, the process is a little trickier. “Make sure you go to someone that knows how to tint eyebrows well and does it often,” Tummala adds. “Grey hair is more resistant and tends to be stubborn, so you might need to adjust the process a bit.”</p><h2 data-node-id title="How soon will you see results?" data-anchor-id=how-soon-will-you-see-results class="body-h2 css-p3fpzg emt9r7s1">How soon will you see results?</h2><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=16 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">You’ll want to avoid getting your brows wet for 12 hours after getting the treatment done, and to clean around the area with gel or cream-based cleansers. “Your brows will stand out and look fuller right away,” Tummala says. “You can cut back on the multiple brow products in your beauty routine.” The tint lasts anywhere from three to six weeks. To maintain color, Tummala suggests coming in every four to six weeks for touch-ups. She also says to avoid exfoliating or the use of any oil-based products in that area as it will cause the tint to fade faster.</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=17 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">Libby recommends avoiding any products that might further irritate the thin eyebrow skin, such as retinoids and retinols. She suggests applying a thin layer of Vaseline or Aquaphor to the surrounding skin as a form of protective barrier between the dye and your skin. Sacks likes castor or almond oil to create the same protective barrier on the brow and to help the tint from fading too fast.</p><p><h2 class="css-1e8n84v e1bddzxd0">Aquaphor Healing Balm Stick</h2></p><a rel="nofollow noopener" href=# aria-label="$10 at Amazon for Healing Balm Stick" data-href=https://www.amazon.com/dp/B09RYRCXKM data-product-url=https://www.amazon.com/dp/B09RYRCXKM data-affiliate=true data-affiliate-url=https://www.amazon.com/dp/B09RYRCXKM data-affiliate-network='{"id":"7f0216f7-084f-4dc8-9190-07ae7162064c","site_id":"229d0812-d901-44db-87b0-24674345b9e5","is_active":true,"details":null,"metadata":{},"network":{"id":"469ce69f-4798-416d-9432-eaa9954b4053","name":"Amazon","is_active":true,"business_unit_id":"ad046b46-538b-42cb-aa54-c3d158875ed6","details":"","metadata":{},"created_at":"2021-07-28T16:03:03.241365+00:00","last_updated_at":"2021-07-28T16:03:03.241381+00:00"}}' data-vars-ga-call-to-action="$10 at Amazon" data-vars-ga-media-role data-vars-ga-media-type="Single Product Embed" data-vars-ga-outbound-link=https://www.amazon.com/dp/B09RYRCXKM data-vars-ga-product-brand=Aquaphor data-vars-ga-product-id=ebc7d937-609c-43fb-be76-d391f79e6f48 data-vars-ga-product-price=$10.47 data-vars-ga-product-retailer-id=2ed0c220-9a04-416a-b7b0-161556b5ac4e data-vars-ga-product-sem3-brand=Aquaphor data-vars-ga-link-treatment="(not set) | (not set)" data-vars-ga-sku=B09RYRCXKM data-vars-ga-magento-tracking=1 class="product-image-link ebgq4gw0 e1b8bpvs0 css-15xslai e1c1bym14"><img alt="Healing Balm Stick" title="Healing Balm Stick" src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/hips.hearstapps.com/vader-prod.s3.amazonaws.com/1705522883-61canfiRZFL.jpg width=2560 height=2560 decoding=async style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center></a><p><h2 class="css-1e8n84v e1bddzxd0">Aquaphor Healing Balm Stick</h2></p><span class="css-1urwh1q e1geg53v2">Credit: Amazon</span><h2 data-node-id title="How safe is the dye? " data-anchor-id=how-safe-is-the-dye class="body-h2 css-p3fpzg emt9r7s1">How safe is the dye?</h2><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=20 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">Be aware that eyebrow tinting dyes aren’t FDA-approved. According to Libby, there is no standard dye formulation and a variety of dyes out there are being used, some of which contain preservatives that aren’t regulated. It is even illegal in California, and, as of 2023, New York, for any licensed professional or salon to carry and administer brow dye to a client. “The major risks with eyebrow tinting are allergic reactions and infections; the skin around the eye is thinner compared to skin on the rest of the body, and more susceptible to allergic reaction and irritation,” she says. “Some permanent eyelash and eyebrow tints/dyes may contain a chemical allergen called para-phenylenediamine (PPD), which can cause severe contact allergy and even blistering reactions.”</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=21 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">Libby recommends doing a patch test to see if you’re allergic to the dye being used before fully committing to a treatment. As with any beauty treatment, always do your homework. Ask around for referrals, and read reviews before booking an appointment.</p><h2 data-node-id title="What are some cons of eyebrow tinting? " data-anchor-id=what-are-some-cons-of-eyebrow-tinting class="body-h2 css-p3fpzg emt9r7s1">What are some cons of eyebrow tinting?</h2><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=23 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">Because the dye only lasts about four to six weeks, you’ll want to go in for monthly brow tinting touch-ups if you love the results and want to maintain them. In addition to the time commitment, it means you’ll also be handing over cash every time you go in. Additionally, as we mentioned earlier, with brow tinting you run the risk of a reaction. With eyebrow tinting in particular, the dye that is used is not regulated, meaning it can vary from salon to salon. If you’re trying a new salon, it’s a good idea to call ahead of time to check which brand of dye they use as well as tips for before and after your appointment that can cut down the risk of irritation. Another thing to keep in mind is that some states don’t require brow technicians to be certified in brow tinting whereas other stars have more diligent requirements. Do some internet searching to find out about your states’ regulations then call the salon and ask about your tech’s certification.</p><h2 data-node-id title="Can I tint my brows at home?" data-anchor-id=can-i-tint-my-brows-at-home class="body-h2 css-p3fpzg emt9r7s1">Can I tint my brows at home?</h2><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=25 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">We recommend closely reviewing the <a href=# data-vars-ga-outbound-link=https://www.fda.gov/consumers/consumer-updates/use-eye-cosmetics-safely data-vars-ga-ux-element=Hyperlink data-vars-ga-call-to-action="FDA’s current safety standards" class="body-link css-1gunp80 emevuu60">FDA’s current safety standards</a>, along with your brow tint kit of choice before trying at-home tinting. Do a quick Amazon search and you’ll find that at-home brow tinting kits are available, but you should use them with caution if you choose to go that route. Plus, you should never use hair dye to tint your eyebrows at home: The formulas of hair dye and eyebrow tint are very different and both should only be used as directed.</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=26 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">While eyebrow tints are typically vegetable-based formulas, at-home hair dyes usually contain ammonia and can be extremely dangerous when used around your eyes. Hair dye and eyebrow tint are very different formulas and should not be used interchangeably. Going to a licensed professional who is certified in brow tinting is always the safest option and you’ll likely see better results.</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=27 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">If you're looking for a way to accentuate and enhance the look of your eyebrows in an affordable way, eyebrow tinting may be a great option. We advise always doing your homework and find a legal salon with a licensed technician that also has experience with eyebrow tinting. Eyebrow tinting can last up to six weeks so it’s a great way to keep your eyebrows defined without having to put too much work into them in the mornings, and it’s also a great treatment to get before a special event.</p><h2 data-node-id title="Meet the Experts" data-anchor-id=meet-the-experts class="body-h2 css-p3fpzg emt9r7s1">Meet the Experts</h2><ul data-node-id=30 class="css-yzf9pi emevuu60"><li>Tiffany Libby, M.D. is a double board-certified dermatologist and MOHS surgeon based in New York City.</li><li>Azi Sacks is a beauty expert at The Brow Studio based in New York City.</li><li>Shobha Tummala is the founder and CEO of Shobha Salon based in New York City.<br></li></ul><h2 data-node-id title="Why trust Harper's Bazaar?" data-anchor-id=why-trust-harpers-bazaar class="body-h2 css-p3fpzg emt9r7s1">Why trust Harper's Bazaar?</h2><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=33 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">For more than 150 years, Harper’s Bazaar has been the preeminent fashion and beauty resource for women at every age.
