The British band found fame with artist Andy Warhol, who starred in their music video MISFIT in 1986.</p><p>The group released three hit albums with popular tunes Down To Earth, Name & No. and Hang On In There Baby. Now the former teen model, rap artist and lead singer is returning to the stage to sing his favourite hits on the 80s Invasion Tour.</p><p>“I’m singing with Big Country, Midge Ure and Nick Heyward. I like having a little boogie on stage!” he says. Here, Ben chats to TV Extra about life after the band and why his fans want more.</p><p>Tell us about the 80s Invasion Tour.</p><p>It’s a weird mix of bands. There was such a diverse variety of choice in the 80s. I’m a blue-eyed soul with a funky twist and then you’ve got these other three acts that are completely different.</p><p>I’m doing my five favourite songs of the 80s, including Misfit, Down to Earth, Ordinary Day, Name and Number original version, and whatever anyone wants me to sing! It’s going to be great.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/i2-prod.dailystar.co.uk/incoming/article15783889.ece/ALTERNATES/s615b/0_Ben-454790><p>Are you looking forward to it?</p><p>Definitely. It’ll be great to see old fans, and hopefully gain some new ones. If I can I’ll try and jump into the audience. I love singing to the crowd.</p><p>How often do you get to catch up with the guys?</p><p>Not at the moment. They’ve all got families now. It does change your life, babies and stuff. I try not to distract them. It’s weird because we spent a lot of time together and became great friends. It’s natural if you’re working and living together.</p><p>You get close. You have a lot in common. Afterwards, it’s a struggle to find common interests. In a way that was the beauty of the band. It was a democracy. Everybody sacrificed their musical suggestions. You had to bite your tongue, go with it and hope for the best.</p><p>Do fans still approach you?</p><p>Yes, it’s quite nice and surprising sometimes. A lot of people give me a hard time. They say I owe it to them and myself to get out there and do something.</p><p>Have you ever been star struck?</p><p>I don’t really get star struck. I did love Debbie Harry. I used to write off to her fan club. I met Prince once. He was a bit moody. Maybe it was because I was taller than him.</p><p>Was it fun to work with Andy Warhol?</p><p>Andy was a real part of my childhood. I had posters of his work on my bedroom wall. Andy was really passionate about our music. It was a real privilege to work with him. We had an amazing week filming our MISFIT video in New York with him. The video was really low budget.</p><p>Andy carried a tape recorder playing our song. It was very organic and underplayed.</p><p>What was he like?</p><p>He wasn’t king of the party, but he was very observant. When he interviewed the band for Famous For 15 Minutes he made some very naughty comments. It was very unexpected coming from what seemed like a reserved person. He seemed like a really nice person. If it hadn’t been for him, we wouldn’t have made a video clip.</p><p>How would you describe your style?</p><p>City meets alley cat. I like a mish mash of smart of scruffy. Andy was different. He looked the same every day, as if he wanted to blend in and study everyone else. When we arrived at the factory in New York, we walked up on to the mezzanine and waved at Andy.</p><p>But it wasn’t him – it was a cardboard cut out! You really couldn’t tell the difference.</p><p>Do you have any style icons?</p><p>I like Gregory Porter. He wears his short suit and funny hat. I admire him for having a style and sticking to it, even though it’s a bit quirky.</p><p>Would you ever do reality TV?</p><p>I’ve thought about it. I don’t think these programmes give you a true image of what’s happening. They go too far and make people look competitive and horrible. They all get a bit too close to the bone. I don’t like seeing people battle on The Voice.</p><p>They don’t bring out the soul in people. I think there should be a music show that brings out more of the person. I’d like to see musicians battle through song writing as opposed to how aggressive they can sing. I’m a bit of a hippy when it comes down to it.</p><p>Do you have any hidden talents?</p><p>I can draw and paint. I’m a good carpenter too. I can scuba dive. That’s pretty cool. You have to remain very calm. That’s a skill, remaining calm in this world with all the panic and drama. I can fish but I’ve never caught a big fish. You should have seen how small the last one was – you could hardly see it!</p><p>What are your DIY skills like?</p><p>They’re all right actually. I’m quite a perfectionist. Some people say I’m slow, but I like to get things right.</p><p>Do you have a life mantra?</p><p>Do unto others. That’s important. I want good for people. That’s my general quest – to have a good time and show other people a good time, and not to get too passionate about world affairs.</p><p>If you hadn’t become a singer, what would you have been?</p><p>I think I would have gone into something artistic. I’m glad I chose music. It helps you to keep your feet on the ground and keep focussed. It’s work and fun.</p><p>Ben Volpeliere is currently on the 80's Invasion tour with Midge Ure, Nick Heyward & Big Country.</p><p>Tickets via tdpromo.com</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7pa3IpbCsrJGne6S7ja6iaKuYpMSjtdlomq6qmaTAqsDYZqKipJyasW6vwK1km52eYsOwuM%2Beo6Kdopp6coORbWhraGE%3D</p><h4><i class="fas fa-share-alt" aria-hidden=true></i>&nbsp;Share!</h4><ul class=share-buttons><li><a href="https://www.facebook.com/sharer/sharer.php?u=%2fcuriosity-killed-cat-ben-volpeliere-17241201.html" target=_blank title="Share on Facebook"><i class="fab fa-facebook" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Share on Facebook</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="https://twitter.com/intent/tweet?source=%2fcuriosity-killed-cat-ben-volpeliere-17241201.html" target=_blank title=Tweet><i class="fab fa-twitter" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Tweet</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="https://plus.google.com/share?url=%2fcuriosity-killed-cat-ben-volpeliere-17241201.html" target=_blank title="Share on Google+"><i class="fab fa-google-plus" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Share on Google+</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="http://www.tumblr.com/share?v=3&u=%2fcuriosity-killed-cat-ben-volpeliere-17241201.html" target=_blank title="Post to Tumblr"><i class="fab fa-tumblr" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Post to Tumblr</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="http://pinterest.com/pin/create/button/?url=%2fcuriosity-killed-cat-ben-volpeliere-17241201.html" target=_blank title="Pin it"><i class="fab fa-pinterest-p" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Pin it</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="http://www.reddit.com/submit?url=%2fcuriosity-killed-cat-ben-volpeliere-17241201.html" target=_blank title="Submit to Reddit"><i class="fab fa-reddit-alien" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Submit to Reddit</span></a></li></ul><style>ul.share-buttons{list-style:none;padding:0}ul.share-buttons li{display:inline}ul.share-buttons .sr-only{position:absolute;clip:rect(1px 1px 1px 1px);clip:rect(1px,1px,1px,1px);padding:0;border:0;height:1px;width:1px;overflow:hidden}</style><div class="prev-next-post pure-g"><div class=pure-u-1-24 style=text-align:left><a href=./megan-moroney-girl-in-the-mirror-lyrics.html><i class="fa fa-chevron-left"></i></a></div><div class=pure-u-10-24><nav class=prev><a href=./megan-moroney-girl-in-the-mirror-lyrics.html>Megan Moroney Says the 'Girl in the Mirror' Is Her</a></nav></div><div class=pure-u-2-24>&nbsp;</div><div class=pure-u-10-24><nav class=next><a href=./chris-perezs-daughter-cassie-perez-and-daughter-noah-perez.html>Chris Prezs Daughter Cassie Perez and Daughter Noah Perez.</a></nav></div><div class=pure-u-1-24 style=text-align:right><a href=./chris-perezs-daughter-cassie-perez-and-daughter-noah-perez.html><i class="fa fa-chevron-right"></i></a></div></div></div></div></div><script src=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/blackburn/js/ui.js></script>
