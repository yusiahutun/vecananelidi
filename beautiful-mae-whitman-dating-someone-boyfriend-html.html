It's a great relationship."</p><p>And when she was asked what she would have done had she not decided to act, she said:</p><p>I was talking about this with my boyfriend. I have the weirdest answers. It would be either working at a zoo helping the animals or as a park ranger. I love being outside. I could also totally see myself giving museum tours. I love talking to people and having them ask questions and getting discussions going about art. What would you do?</p><p>Not only that,&nbsp;the Glamour interviewer also asked her about her dating preference. To the question "Do you have a type?", she responded:</p><p>It's constantly changing. I just like people. I like everyone. I see so much wonderful potential in everyone that I meet, and there's always something to learn from. I think girls are attractive, I think boys are attractive, I think old people are attractive, I think young people are—I appreciate everything and everyone. &nbsp;</p><p>Nevertheless, she was also rumored to be dating Haley Joel Osment in 2002.
