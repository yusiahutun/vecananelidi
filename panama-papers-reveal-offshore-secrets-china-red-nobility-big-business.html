The Mossack Fonseca franchise now has offices in eight Chinese cities, according to its website.</p><p class=dcr-1yimvw>There are many legitimate reasons to use offshore companies. Individuals living in multiple jurisdictions find them convenient, and in China they are often used as a way to attract and safeguard investment from overseas. While there is no indication of any wrongdoing, the leaks draw unwelcome attention to the wealth of leaders’ families.
