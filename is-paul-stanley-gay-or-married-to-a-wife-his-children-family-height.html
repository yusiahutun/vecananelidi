He began his career over five decades ago and has earned his place on the list of the most important metal singers of all time. In addition to his career with Kiss, which has had a major impact on his musical career, he has also done some work as a solo artist.</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading><strong>Paul Stanley – Biography</strong></h2><p>Although most people know the singer as Paul Stanley, he was actually born as Stanley Bert Eisen on January 20, 1952, in Manhattan, New York City. He came from a Jewish family and grew up alongside a younger sister, Julia.</p><p>What is interesting for such a famous singer is that he grew up with a deformed ear, which made it difficult for him to understand where sounds come from, or even to hear very well in a noisy environment. However, he loved music and started singing when he was a small child. At the age of seven, he already had his first guitar.</p><p>He began his training at PS 98 before his family moved to Kew Gardens at the age of eight. While the music was his first love, he also had a talent for graphic arts. He went to the High School of Music & Art in New York, where he graduated in 1970.</p><p>The singer began his career with a local band, Rainbow. In the 1970s he joined other bands, including Wicked Lester, before finally settling into Kiss, which he formed in 1973 with Gene Simmons, Ace Frehley, and Peter Criss. He released over 20 albums with the band and won many awards.</p><p>Stanley has not made many recordings as a solo singer, but he has been able to release two albums: Paul Stanley (1978) and Live to Win (2006). He also released the live album One Live Kiss in 2008.</p><p><strong>ALSO READ: <a href=#>Kat Von D Biography, Net Worth, Husband, Parents, and Family Life</a></strong></p><p>The singer has achieved many successes, including “Showman of the Year” at the 2008 Classic Rock Awards, the 2009 Classic Gold Telly Award, and was inducted into the Long Island Music Hall of Fame in 2006 and the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame in 2014.</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading><strong>Family – Children, Is He Gay Or Married To A Wife?</strong></h2><figure id=attachment_40007 class="wp-caption aligncenter amp-wp-inline-086b83d24e4412010a175ea3dba11ca3" aria-describedby=caption-attachment-40007></figure><p>Paul Stanley is one of those stars who had many rumors about their sexuality. For many years there have been many people who claim that the singer is gay, although there is not much to support this claim. But the rumors were serious enough to make the star realize that he is not gay.</p><p>According to him, he has never looked at boys in this way before. He pointed out that although he has no problem with a person’s sexuality, as long as you are a good person, he is completely heterosexual.</p><p>Marilyn Manson described the band as “four gay guys in Halloween costumes”, something that was not well received by Stanley and other band members.</p><p>Even with the rumors about his sexuality, the singer not only had a wife, but he dated more women than many men would ever get. Among the women he allegedly dated are Georganne LaPiere, Donna Dixon, with whom he was supposedly once engaged, Lisa Hartman, Cathy St. George, and Eloise DeJoria.</p><p>In 1991 Paul Stanley married Pamela Bowen 1991. Unfortunately, the marriage ended in divorce 10 years later, leaving the singer devastated. To get a grip on the problem, he turned to his second love, painting. Before it ended, the union was blessed with a child, Evan Shane Stanley, born in 1994.</p><p><strong>ALSO READ: <a href=#>Who Is Kenny Omega of WWE, Is He Gay or Bisexual, What Is His Net Worth?</a></strong></p><p>After the divorce from his first wife, Paul Stanley met Erin Sutton, whom he was to marry later in 2005.
