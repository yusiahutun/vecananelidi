Life has been rewarding for him since then, and likewise, there is an ample number of women just wanting to be the special someone in his life to share giggles and smiles with him.&nbsp; <span id=ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-607 class=ezoic-adpicker-ad></span></p><p>However, Smith, is already booked and a committed man, as it seems. Well, we are sure of it. As per an article named <a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">Slug Mag&nbsp;</a>that dates back to August 14, 2015,&nbsp;he was thinking about marriage,&nbsp;</p><p>"He’s about to get married to the love of his life, Erica, so at the moment he’s concentrating on that."</p><span class="ezoic-autoinsert-ad ezoic-under_second_paragraph"></span><p>On that note, it looks like Smith does have a love of his life named Erica, and she must be his wife now. However, little to no information surrounds Shayne's life regarding this matter.&nbsp; <span id=ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-608 class=ezoic-adpicker-ad></span></p><span class="ezoic-autoinsert-ad ezoic-under_second_paragraph"></span><p>Maybe they did not get married, or perhaps the goofy comedian has successfully kept the details of his marriage a secret.&nbsp;</p><span class="ezoic-autoinsert-ad ezoic-mid_content"></span><p>All and all, the funny personality has occasionally mentioned details of his wife. Well, it might not be romantic and awesome but&nbsp;it sure is hilarious.&nbsp;</p><p><strong>Dating Life Of Another Comedian:</strong>&nbsp;<a href=# rel=follow>Comedian Kevin Bridges On-Off Relationship With Girlfriend, Susan Riddell: Still Dating?</a></p><p>Taking to his Twitter in early January 2017, he made a tweet that, well, we can't explain in words, here you judge for yourself.&nbsp; <span id=ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-609 class=ezoic-adpicker-ad></span></p><p></p><p><strong>Shayne Smith's Tweet Mentioning His Wife</strong> (Source <a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">Twitter</a>)&nbsp; <span id=ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-611 class=ezoic-adpicker-ad></span></p><span class="ezoic-autoinsert-ad ezoic-mid_content"></span><p>Nop! not even going to explain that.&nbsp;</p><p>While one would guess that Smith's married life is flourishing, but a particular tweet made by him over a year ago has made us question our views.&nbsp;</p><p>The original tweet by the user is now deleted; however, his reply to the tweet is still evident. He wrote,&nbsp; <span id=ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-612 class=ezoic-adpicker-ad></span></p><p>"Guide me through another divorce baby I’m still learning"</p><span class="ezoic-autoinsert-ad ezoic-long_content"></span><p>Due to the unavailability of the context, not much can be said about the conversation; however, "another divorce" is what has caught our&nbsp;attention.&nbsp;</p><p>So could it be that he divorced his wife that he was to marry back in 2015? The question shall remain unanswered until Smith sheds a clear light on the matter.&nbsp;</p><p>However, interestingly Smith is quite vocal when mentioning his gay rumors and making tweets regarding the matter, which are not the ones to be missed.&nbsp;</p><span class="ezoic-autoinsert-ad ezoic-long_content"></span><h2>Is Shayne Smith Gay?</h2><p>Smith is speculated to be gay at times, and considering the tweets and quotes he makes regarding the matter, the speculation does not seem far-fetched.&nbsp;</p><p>Recently, he made a hilarious tweet comparing how people perceive him with a man to a woman. He went ahead to express that even if he were gay with a man, people would see it as them being good friends, and on the contrary, if he were with a girl (a friend), people would presume him to be hooking up with her.&nbsp; <span id=ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-613 class=ezoic-adpicker-ad></span></p><p></p><span class="ezoic-autoinsert-ad ezoic-longer_content"></span><p>It's unclear if Smith was being serious especially given his nature&nbsp;not much can be formulated through his tweet.&nbsp;</p><p>Smith, age 34, now lives a life bringing smiles and laughter to people's lives and, over the years, he has successfully catered to making millions of fans through his content.&nbsp; <span id=ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-636 class=ezoic-adpicker-ad></span></p><p><strong>Openly Gay Comedian:&nbsp;</strong><a href=# rel=follow>Gay Comedian Josh Thomas: Wondering Who is His Boyfriend?

But it's impressive how early he has made a mark for himself in this hard-earned career.&nbsp;</p><p>In an Interview with <a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">Gore Mutual</a> in early 2020, he had revealed that he earned more than $10,000&nbsp;a year, but he was not rich by any means whatsoever.&nbsp;</p><span class="ezoic-autoinsert-ad ezoic-longer_content"></span><p>He started his career with stand-up at Wiseguys Comedy Club in 2014; he has worked for Prison for Wizards, Comedy and Other Opinions, Wiseguys Sunday Night Special, and many such comedy clubs.&nbsp; <span id=ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-637 class=ezoic-adpicker-ad></span></p><p>With the recognition he has gained over the years, Smith has accumulated net worth ranking up to a six-figure range.&nbsp;</p><span id=ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-655></span><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmikmauys63MqaypZpOkunC8jqyfmrGemnq0ucitn2avmZuybsDArauop6NitKLFjaGrpqQ%3D</p><h4><i class="fas fa-share-alt" aria-hidden=true></i>&nbsp;Share!</h4><ul class=share-buttons><li><a href="https://www.facebook.com/sharer/sharer.php?u=%2fshayne-smith-wife-tattoos-gay-html.html" target=_blank title="Share on Facebook"><i class="fab fa-facebook" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Share on Facebook</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="https://twitter.com/intent/tweet?source=%2fshayne-smith-wife-tattoos-gay-html.html" target=_blank title=Tweet><i class="fab fa-twitter" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Tweet</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="https://plus.google.com/share?url=%2fshayne-smith-wife-tattoos-gay-html.html" target=_blank title="Share on Google+"><i class="fab fa-google-plus" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Share on Google+</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="http://www.tumblr.com/share?v=3&u=%2fshayne-smith-wife-tattoos-gay-html.html" target=_blank title="Post to Tumblr"><i class="fab fa-tumblr" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Post to Tumblr</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="http://pinterest.com/pin/create/button/?url=%2fshayne-smith-wife-tattoos-gay-html.html" target=_blank title="Pin it"><i class="fab fa-pinterest-p" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Pin it</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="http://www.reddit.com/submit?url=%2fshayne-smith-wife-tattoos-gay-html.html" target=_blank title="Submit to Reddit"><i class="fab fa-reddit-alien" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Submit to Reddit</span></a></li></ul><style>ul.share-buttons{list-style:none;padding:0}ul.share-buttons li{display:inline}ul.share-buttons .sr-only{position:absolute;clip:rect(1px 1px 1px 1px);clip:rect(1px,1px,1px,1px);padding:0;border:0;height:1px;width:1px;overflow:hidden}</style><div class="prev-next-post pure-g"><div class=pure-u-1-24 style=text-align:left><a href=./jillian-mele.html><i class="fa fa-chevron-left"></i></a></div><div class=pure-u-10-24><nav class=prev><a href=./jillian-mele.html>Jillian Mele Biography</a></nav></div><div class=pure-u-2-24>&nbsp;</div><div class=pure-u-10-24><nav class=next><a href=./asking-friend-help-all-my-friends-are.html>Asking for a friend: Help!
