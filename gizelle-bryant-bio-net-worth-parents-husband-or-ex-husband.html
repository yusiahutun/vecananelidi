She is the mother of three daughters and a philanthropist who works with the government, particularly on Birmingham City Council, Alabama.</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading><strong>Gizelle Bryant Bio</strong></h2><p>Gizelle Bryant was born on September 9, 1970, in Houston, Texas, and grew up in a prominent political family where she learned everything she knows about government issues; she is one of three children born in her family.</p><p>Bryant attended privately owned Hampton University in Virginia, where she earned a degree in marketing and later got a job as an event planner with the NAACP.</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading><strong>Career</strong></h2><p>Gizelle Bryant began as a normal working-class lady; she was an event planner and model. She was also popular as a prominent pastor’s wife and “First Lady” of the Empowerment Temple AME Church in Baltimore.</p><p><strong>ALSO READ: <a href=#>Donte DiVincenzo (NBA) Biography, Parents, Girlfriend, Height, and Weight</a></strong></p><p>In addition to her seven- to eight-year popularity as the wife of the pastor of the megachurch, Jamal Bryant, she began appearing as one of the characters in a TV reality series, The Real Housewives of Potomac, alongside four other wealthy women. To date, the reality show has over 46 episodes that are shown in and around America.</p><p>With her experience as an event planner, Bryant has become an avid entrepreneur who knows how to diversify her income stream. She started her own line of baked goods; she baked delicious desserts and sold them in famous restaurants, including one of the contestants in one of the most popular cooking shows, top chef Timothy Dean. Bryant also works with the government, which is not so surprising considering that she grew up in a political family.</p><p>There are simply no limits to Gizelle Bryant as a businesswoman. Right now, the mother of three has her very own makeup line called EveryHue Beauty. Bryant launched the beauty products in collaboration with three other women, Karlene Damallie, Erika Liles, and Sophia Rabkin, who believe that “beauty comes in all shapes, sizes, and complexions,” as the company’s website stated.</p><p>Speaking about her goal of creating EveryHue Beauty, Bryant said she believes that the body of the temple and the skin is a canvas and that everyone has the potential to look radiant and perfect.</p><p>The beauty products focus on the needs of all modern women and the multi-ethnic woman. While the beauty business is up and running, Bryant is working on the publication of her first book, which she said will reveal her life in the church and the sordid deeds around the world of faith.</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading><strong>Net Worth</strong></h2><p>As a television personality and businesswoman, Gizelle Bryant earns a lot of money for her entire life, and the net worth of the star of The Real Housewives of Potomac is estimated at $4 million. She lives with her three daughters in a $1.6 million home in Bethesda, where she occasionally takes a look at her life through social media.</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading><strong>Parents</strong></h2><p>The parents of Gizelle Bryant are Curtis and Joanne Graves. Her father, Curtis, was a member of the Texas House of Representatives from 1967 to 1973. He was the first African American to hold this post. Bryant’s father worked at NASA for another 30 years after the end of his tenure in Washington and is now an art photographer.</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading><strong>Husband Or Ex-Husband</strong></h2><p>Gizelle Bryant was married to Rev. Jamal H. Bryant of the Empowerment Temple AME Church in Baltimore, Maryland. She was a wife and First Lady of the ministry for about eight years (2002-2009) before the marriage broke up due to irreconcilable differences. The beauty mogul did not want to stay in the marriage after she discovered her husband’s infidelity. In her opinion “you only have one life and you don’t have to stay in something that makes you unhappy”.</p><p><strong>ALSO READ: <a href=#>Mike Golic Wife, Daughter, Son, Brother Family, Height, Salary</a></strong></p><p>The couple has three daughters in common, Grace Bryant, Angel Bryant, and Adore Bryant. In addition to their three daughters, her husband has two other children outside marriage, Topaz Bryant and John Karston Bryant.</p><p>Bryant left her husband in Baltimore and returned with the girls to Potomac. Despite their separation, she continues to use her ex-husband’s name and revealed that the two [she and her ex-husband] have remained good friends and do a good job of raising their children together.</p><p>With her personal marital experience, Gizelle Bryant took it upon herself to counsel other women and give them advice on how to deal with their own situations. But that doesn’t mean that the star of The Real Housewives of Potomac doesn’t want to go out anymore. In one of her interviews on Bravo TV in August 2018, Bryant said that she started dating again and that she and the mystery man are working to make it work.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmiblaGyo7XLsmWcp51ktKrGxKWjnmWSp8aiutNmmaKnXaOytXnWqKmtoF2lrrOxza2qZqClqK%2BiusNmpqtlla16qcHSm5innF8%3D</p><h4><i class="fas fa-share-alt" aria-hidden=true></i>&nbsp;Share!</h4><ul class=share-buttons><li><a href="https://www.facebook.com/sharer/sharer.php?u=%2fgizelle-bryant-bio-net-worth-parents-husband-or-ex-husband.html" target=_blank title="Share on Facebook"><i class="fab fa-facebook" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Share on Facebook</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="https://twitter.com/intent/tweet?source=%2fgizelle-bryant-bio-net-worth-parents-husband-or-ex-husband.html" target=_blank title=Tweet><i class="fab fa-twitter" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Tweet</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="https://plus.google.com/share?url=%2fgizelle-bryant-bio-net-worth-parents-husband-or-ex-husband.html" target=_blank title="Share on Google+"><i class="fab fa-google-plus" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Share on Google+</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="http://www.tumblr.com/share?v=3&u=%2fgizelle-bryant-bio-net-worth-parents-husband-or-ex-husband.html" target=_blank title="Post to Tumblr"><i class="fab fa-tumblr" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Post to Tumblr</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="http://pinterest.com/pin/create/button/?url=%2fgizelle-bryant-bio-net-worth-parents-husband-or-ex-husband.html" target=_blank title="Pin it"><i class="fab fa-pinterest-p" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Pin it</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="http://www.reddit.com/submit?url=%2fgizelle-bryant-bio-net-worth-parents-husband-or-ex-husband.html" target=_blank title="Submit to Reddit"><i class="fab fa-reddit-alien" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Submit to Reddit</span></a></li></ul><style>ul.share-buttons{list-style:none;padding:0}ul.share-buttons li{display:inline}ul.share-buttons .sr-only{position:absolute;clip:rect(1px 1px 1px 1px);clip:rect(1px,1px,1px,1px);padding:0;border:0;height:1px;width:1px;overflow:hidden}</style><div class="prev-next-post pure-g"><div class=pure-u-1-24 style=text-align:left><a href=./iowa-states-jake-remsburg-suspended-ncaa-gambling-violations-html.html><i class="fa fa-chevron-left"></i></a></div><div class=pure-u-10-24><nav class=prev><a href=./iowa-states-jake-remsburg-suspended-ncaa-gambling-violations-html.html>Iowa State's Jake Remsburg 'is suspended over NCAA gambling violations,' becoming the fifth projecte</a></nav></div><div class=pure-u-2-24>&nbsp;</div><div class=pure-u-10-24><nav class=next><a href=./stunning-celebrity-walk-in-wardrobe-dressing-rooms-photos.html>Epic celebrity walk-in wardrobes: Victoria Beckham, Ruth Langsford and more</a></nav></div><div class=pure-u-1-24 style=text-align:right><a href=./stunning-celebrity-walk-in-wardrobe-dressing-rooms-photos.html><i class="fa fa-chevron-right"></i></a></div></div></div></div></div><script src=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/blackburn/js/ui.js></script>
