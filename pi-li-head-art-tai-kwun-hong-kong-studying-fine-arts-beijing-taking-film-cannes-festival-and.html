My father’s studio was in our home. Many people gathered there, and I always listened. It invoked my ambition to study art history, the same as my father.</p><h3 type=h3 data-qa=Component-Component class="e14khtrb0 css-17x7qa9 e793b7w1"><a class="link-text css-e0dnmk ef1hf1w0" href=# data-qa=BaseLink-renderAnchor-StyledAnchor><p><span data-qa=DigitalArchiveLink-TitleText class="css-66qo9a eeeqn932">Art Basel Hong Kong and M+ museum for debate in Post panel discussion</span></p></a></h3><h3 type=h3 data-qa=Component-Component class="e14khtrb0 css-17x7qa9 e793b7w1">Honour and privilege</h3><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">When I was 18, I left Wuhan for the first time and went to Beijing to study at the Central Academy of Fine Arts (CAFA). It was a privileged education. At the time, the academy only accepted 40 to 50 applicants from all over China and only nine people in the Art History Department.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">The academy was in the centre of Beijing, a 10-minute walk from Tiananmen Square, and all our professors were well known. The library was extensive, and I began to read a lot of magazines to practise my English.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/cdn.i-scmp.com/sites/default/files/d8/images/canvas/2023/03/17/70b2160f-e089-4b4d-a95d-32a9b066bd7e_34e1b52d.jpg><h3 type=h3 data-qa=Component-Component class="e14khtrb0 css-17x7qa9 e793b7w1">Rock ’n’ roll</h3><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">Art school was fun. There were no barriers between the students and the professors, some of them famous artists. There was no hierarchy, it was quite a democratic environment.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">Art school is a nice place for subculture. Rock music was important with singers like Cui Jian and that generation of musicians. They practised in our school because it was in the centre of town and had the best studio. At that time, I must have appeared very rock ’n’ roll because I had long hair and wore jeans.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/cdn.i-scmp.com/sites/default/files/d8/images/canvas/2023/03/17/e874c541-e9f0-4477-a918-4b0f232cd4cf_f2a229d3.jpg><h3 type=h3 data-qa=Component-Component class="e14khtrb0 css-17x7qa9 e793b7w1">Master of destiny</h3><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">After I completed the four-year degree, I applied to do a master’s but was not accepted. I was a good student, but at that time CAFA was not so open to modern art. It was seen as fashionable but not academic.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">My professor liked me, so he gave me a small salary to work as a librarian in the school for a year. I applied for the master’s the following year and was turned down again.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">I got a job working in a private gallery, Courtyard Gallery, one of the first commercial galleries in Beijing, which were all run by foreigners. The gallery was at the East Gate of the Forbidden City, a very exotic place, and I worked there for four years from 1997 as a gallery assistant.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">In 1998, on my fourth attempt to join the master’s programme, I was accepted.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/cdn.i-scmp.com/sites/default/files/d8/images/canvas/2023/03/17/210df322-e8b0-476a-af03-88a81e8b4245_6d1f93d2.jpg><h3 type=h3 data-qa=Component-Component class="e14khtrb0 css-17x7qa9 e793b7w1">Bonnie Scotland</h3><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">In 1999, I was selected by the British Council to be a visiting artist in Glasgow, in the UK, my first trip abroad. Also in my group was a dancer, Jin Xing, who is now a very famous transgender moderator on television.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">I’d studied English for many years but when I got to Glasgow, I doubted myself – the Scottish accent is very strong. It was a nice three months at the Glasgow School of Art and the Centre for Contemporary Arts.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">It got dark early, so I watched a lot of films, tried whisky and met lots of artists. Glasgow was poor and there were not many commercial galleries. Most institutions were non-profit and there were many alternative spaces.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">Before Glasgow, I had no idea of the difference between the commercial gallery and the not-for-profit space. It was an eye-opener, and I thought, “OK, this is something we can try.”</p><h3 type=h3 data-qa=Component-Component class="e14khtrb0 css-17x7qa9 e793b7w1">Peak time</h3><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">I met my wife, Yang, when we were seven. Our fathers were colleagues. She trained as a painter. We got married in 2001, had our first child in 2008 and our second in 2010.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">In 2001, I completed my master’s. It was a year that changed China. It had recently been confirmed as host of the 2008 Olympics and then Shanghai was confirmed as host of the World Expo in 2010.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">It was a peak time for China and the country was suddenly open. China was committed to cosmopolitanism and was open to contemporary art. The government didn’t want to show traditional China, they wanted to show contemporary culture.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">Along with colleagues at CAFA, we formed the curatorial team for several major shows, including the 2003 Shanghai Biennale where I was the assistant curator.</p><h3 type=h3 data-qa=Component-Component class="e14khtrb0 css-17x7qa9 e793b7w1"><a class="link-text css-e0dnmk ef1hf1w0" href=# data-qa=BaseLink-renderAnchor-StyledAnchor><p><span data-qa=DigitalArchiveLink-TitleText class="css-66qo9a eeeqn932">Art Basel Hong Kong: restaurants celebrate with yummy culinary art</span></p></a></h3><h3 type=h3 data-qa=Component-Component class="e14khtrb0 css-17x7qa9 e793b7w1">Student bodies</h3><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">Alongside the exhibitions, I was teaching at CAFA and doing my PhD – it was a busy time. In 1999, the government decided to enlarge the scale of higher education and the number of students admitted to college increased by more than 40 per cent from 1998.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">By 2005, the number of new students was more than four times that of 1998.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/cdn.i-scmp.com/sites/default/files/d8/images/canvas/2023/03/17/f1539f1e-19d2-43eb-96da-0aa8b2e9435e_6670f9b0.jpg><h3 type=h3 data-qa=Component-Component class="e14khtrb0 css-17x7qa9 e793b7w1">Dreams come true</h3><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">A friend, Wang Xiaoshuai, at the time an underground director, asked me to help him make a film. I’d always dreamed of making a film, so I helped with the promotion and fundraising, and became a producer for Shanghai Dreams (2005).</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">After many challenges, we managed to get a permit to show the film and it won the jury prize at the Cannes Film Festival. I was on the red carpet at Cannes.</p><figure data-qa=Component-StyledFigure class="css-1yuz473 exv1azg4">The curators for the major museums in China and some in the United States, and the commercial auctioneers are all graduates of CAFA.Pi Li on the prestigious Central Academy of Fine Arts, in Beijing</figure><h3 type=h3 data-qa=Component-Component class="e14khtrb0 css-17x7qa9 e793b7w1">Joining the mafia</h3><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">I was interested in not-for-profits so I built a not-for-profit space near the academy, which we called Universal Studios Beijing. Eventually we were sued by the real Universal, so we changed the name to Boers-Li Gallery.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">When the financial crisis struck and we were struggling, we changed it to a commercial gallery. I stayed with that gallery alongside teaching for 11 years.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">The curators for the major museums in China and some in the United States, and the commercial auctioneers are all graduates of CAFA. We are the mafia of the art world in China.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">In China there is a law that you have to finish your PhD within 10 years, so in 2009, I took a one-year break to complete it. It was a nice time. My wife was pregnant with our second child and after working on my doctorate I’d take a walk with her in the afternoon.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">Our daughter was born in June 2010 and I finished my PhD the same month.</p><h3 type=h3 data-qa=Component-Component class="e14khtrb0 css-17x7qa9 e793b7w1">Hong Kong bound</h3><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">In 2012, I began to get bored with contemporary art projects in the government; it was quite bureaucratic. So I stepped down.

In the next two or three decades there won’t be another big museum like M+. It is a world-class visual-culture museum, it is the museum that holds the most comprehensive collection of contemporary Chinese art.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">M+ opened in 2021 and in 2022 I got the opportunity to join Tai Kwun as head of art. Unlike M+, Tai Kwun is small, it’s more like an arts centre and has no collection.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">The main reason I joined Tai Kwun was that it’s small but beautiful, and close to the living art – you can react fast to the art scene. A great city like Hong Kong needs diversity – you should have an M+ but you also should have an energetic space like Tai Kwun.</p><h3 type=h3 data-qa=Component-Component class="e14khtrb0 css-17x7qa9 e793b7w1">Destination Hong Kong</h3><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">After a decade of working for M+ I wanted to do something international, something for the young people, for the current art scene, to be more flexible. Now that the pandemic is over we can plan things.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">I am excited to be involved in making Tai Kwun an important cultural destination not only for Hong Kong but for the region.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">After 10 years here I’m a Hongkonger; it’s a global city and I truly believe people will come back.
