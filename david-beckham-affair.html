From his humble working-class beginnings in east London, his drive and determination to win, and the battle to find balance between ambition,&nbsp;<a rel="noreferrer noopener" href=#>love and family</a>, David’s story is one of immense ups and downs. The series takes you on that rollercoaster and builds a surprising, personal and definitive story of one of the most recognizable and scrutinized athletes of all time.”</p><p>“In&nbsp;Beckham, Academy Award-winner Fisher Stevens (Palmer,&nbsp;And We Go Green,&nbsp;The Cove) along with Academy Award and Emmy Award-winning producer John Battsek (One Day in September,&nbsp;Searching for Sugar Man,&nbsp;Winter on Fire) are granted unprecedented access to David, his wife Victoria, his family, his friends and his team-mates. The result is an intimate portrait of a man as well as a chronicle of late-modern sports and celebrity culture.”</p><p>Here’s a timeline of David Beckham’s alleged affair and what he and Victoria Beckham have said about it.</p><p>Here’s the timeline of David Beckham’s affair.</p><ul class="pmc-fallback-list-items lrv-a-unstyle-list lrv-u-margin-t-2"><li class="pmc-fallback-list-item-wrap lrv-u-margin-b-2" readability=7.9259259259259><h2>2023: Rebecca Loos receives backlash after the documentary</h2><p>After the Netflix documentary aired, Rebecca Loos faced “disgusting” comments against her on an Instagram post of her in a yoga position, to which she replied: “Thank you 🙏🏼 am taking in the nasty comments with as much humour as I can ❤️.” Mostly, though, there were messages of support.</p><p>One fan questioned: “Why is the other woman always subjected to such hate? Why not the married man? Bet there’s no nasty comments on his Insta page!” Another wrote: “The amount of hate this poor lady is receiving is shocking. Most of them mothers, some of them are shouting about mental health in their bios. To bring another woman down and troll her says much more about you!” A third commented: “She’s been living a quiet and what appears to be a very content life,” a third commented. “To be dragged into this again is sad.”</p><p>The yoga practitioner then made an Instagram poll asking whether or not she should speak out about it. “A part of me wants to continue keeping down and getting on with my life, the other part of me wants to speak out,” the poll read on her Instagram story via <a href=# data-type=URL data-id=https://www.dailymail.co.uk/tvshowbiz/article-12620225/Rebecca-Loos-shares-cryptic-post-Instagram-asking-fans-speak-head-following-claims-lied-David-Beckham-affair.html rel=nofollow>Daily Mail.</a></p></li><li class="pmc-fallback-list-item-wrap lrv-u-margin-b-2" readability=19.5><h2>2023: David & Victoria Break Silence About Affair Allegations</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/stylecaster.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/david-victoria-beckham.png><p>In Beckham, Victoria revealed her true feelings about the time of the affair allegations. “You know, up until Madrid, sometimes it felt like us against everybody else but we were together, we were connected, we had each other,” she said. “But when we were in Spain, it didn’t really feel like we had each other either. And that’s sad. I can’t even begin to tell you how hard it was and how it affected me. It was a nightmare. It was an absolute circus — and everyone loves it when the circus comes to town, right? Unless you’re in it.”</p><p>When asked if she resented her husband at the time, Victoria answered in the affirmative. “If I’m being totally honest, yes, I did,” she admitted. “It was the most unhappy I have ever been in my entire life. It wasn’t that I felt unheard because I was always mindful of the focus that he needed.”</p><p>Echoing his sentiments from the statement he issued at the time, David admitted: “There was some horrible stories which were difficult to deal with. It was the first time that me and Victoria had been put under that kind of pressure in our marriage.”</p><p>When asked how their marriage survived this barrage of controversy, David explained, “Every time that we woke up we felt, you know, there was something else and, you know, we felt that, we both felt at the time that we were not losing each other but drowning.</p><p>“But ultimately, it’s our private life,” he added. “There were some days I thought, ‘How am I going to go to work? How am I going to go on that training pitch and look as if nothing is wrong?’ I felt physically sick every day when I opened my eyes. How am I going to do this?”</p></li><li class="pmc-fallback-list-item-wrap lrv-u-margin-b-2" readability=1.9440124416796><h2>2013: Rebecca Loos speaks out about David Beckham affair</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/stylecaster.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/GettyImages-83409044.jpg><p>In 2013, Rebecca Loos talked about the affair and the impact it has made on her family and the Beckhams. “I’m a mother now and married, and knowing what I know now I would definitely have gone about things quite differently,”&nbsp;<a rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow" href=#>the Metro reported</a>. “I was young and foolish and very reckless. I didn’t think things through and acted on impulse a lot. I think I regret the impact on everybody.

It was a really tough time,” she says. “It was hard for our entire families. But I realized a lot of people have a price.”</p><p>“David and I got through it together,” Victoria continues. “No one said marriage was going to be easy. Yes, there have been bumps along the road. But the fact is we’ve come out of everything we’ve been through stronger and happier. It’s even better now than when we were first married. After all these years, we can just come home and have a laugh together.” She even said that they don’t read the papers anymore. ”We just look at the pictures, to be honest”</p></li><li class="pmc-fallback-list-item-wrap lrv-u-margin-b-2" readability=-0.5><h2>2004: David Beckham Slams Tabloids About The Affair</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/stylecaster.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/david-beckham.png><p>David Beckham talked to BBC Radio 4 about the media attention surrounding his alleged affairs. “I’ve made it clear that with two papers the way I and my family have been treated is an absolute disgrace because at the end of the day, I’m a nice person and loving husband and father.”</p></li><li class="pmc-fallback-list-item-wrap lrv-u-margin-b-2" readability=0.98443579766537><h2>2004: David Beckham Denies Cheating Allegations For The 2nd Time</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/stylecaster.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/david-beckham-victoria.png><p>Beckham denied the cheating claims in a statement to the&nbsp;<a href=# rel=nofollow>Guardian</a>&nbsp;at the time.</p><p>“This weekend a series of even more absurd and unsubstantiated claims have been published about David and Victoria Beckham,” the statement read. “The couple continue to dismiss these stories and they will not be commenting upon them further at this time.
