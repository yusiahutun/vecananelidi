This is what <a href=#>psychology</a> refers to as herd mentality, otherwise known as mob mentality or crowd mentality. Some real-life examples of herd mentality include –&nbsp;</p><ul><li>Spreading of viral content on social media and the urge to recreate the same</li><li>Buying trendy clothes without considering the economic and environmental consequences&nbsp;</li><li>Following the idea of majority in political scenarios – for example, the Rise of Nazi Germany – without considering its impact on others and the future</li><li>Panic buying in times of crises, such as the COVID-19 pandemic</li></ul><h4 class=wp-block-heading>Why does this happen?</h4><p>Because humans are social beings inherently!&nbsp;</p><p>We seek other guidance and validation from time to time. Our brains also take mental shortcuts, due to which we conform with the majority, without thinking critically about the group’s views and behaviours. Further, the need for belongingness sits on the third rung of Maslow’s hierarchy of needs. This indicates that people also long to belong and fit in with group norms.&nbsp;</p><p><strong>Read More: <a href=#>How does Socializing improve your Quality of Life?</a></strong></p><p>Another reason behind mob mentality would be the influence people experience before they conform to a certain behavioural tendency or belief pattern. This influence could be of two types – informational and normative. Informational influence is seen when people change their behaviour to appear correct. It is like saying “If the majority must be doing it, it is correct!” However, they fail to understand that the behaviour of the majority might not be always right in all situations. On the other hand, normative influence occurs when people want to avoid punishments and gain rewards that come with following a certain group.&nbsp;</p><p><strong>Read More: <a href=#>Psychology Behind Choices</a></strong></p><h4 class=wp-block-heading>How to recognize the signs of herd mentality?</h4><p>Look out for these signs in you or others to detect herd mentality.</p><ul><li>Group polarization&nbsp;refers to a psychological phenomenon wherein the attitudes, beliefs and decisions of the involved groups tend to be more amplified or extreme than held by individual group members. This might escalate conflicts, marginalize minority viewpoints, and a potential for groupthink. Check if the collective opinion of the group is extreme.</li><li>Diffusion of responsibility&nbsp;refers to that phenomenon where individuals diffuse their responsibility towards a certain incident because they feel others will take care of it. For example, accidents and crime sightings get reported late because the people passing by it diffuse their responsibility, by giving excuses.&nbsp;</li></ul><p><strong>Read More: <a href=#>How Emotions Play an Important Role in Decision-Making</a></strong></p><ul><li>Conformity&nbsp;refers to the act of changing one’s behaviours to fit in with the people around them. Check if you or other people change their beliefs or behaviours to align with the majority, even if it is contradictory to that of their own.&nbsp;</li><li>Groupthink&nbsp;refers to the phenomenon where the members of the group prioritize consensus more than thinking critically and rationally about making decisions. Check if your group is turning towards irrational decision-making.&nbsp;</li><li>You or the other person feel discouraged to express opinions that are contrary and could challenge that status quo.&nbsp;</li></ul><h4 class=wp-block-heading>Negative effects of herd mentality&nbsp;</h4><p>Mob mentality gives a sense of power, and often puts the mob into a frenzy of escalating power and <a href=#>aggression</a>. Individuals lose their sense of identity and are provided with a sense of anonymity. As a result, extreme deviant behaviours are seen along with mob mentality typically.&nbsp; Further, following the herd puts people in a fixated state where they are not open to new ideas and facts, even if those ideas are more relevant and appropriate. They lose their ability to think critically and rationally. This tendency is the reason behind many gruesome wars and international conflicts in history. Some examples include the Salem Witch trials, the holocaust, the current Israel-Palestine conflicts and genocides, and the religious disputes in India.&nbsp;</p><p><strong>Read More: <a href=#>Are you suffering from an Identity Crisis?</a></strong></p><h5 class=wp-block-heading>Positive side-effects of herd mentality&nbsp;</h5><p>In some cases, herd mentality may have positive effects. This is possible in situations where people do not have extensive information and/or expertise. Therefore, the group’s knowledge as a collective outweighs that of any single individual and could lead to better outcomes. Another benefit would be that following the majority, or the group’s collective judgment, can help speed up the decision-making process.</p><p><strong>Read More: <a href=#>How to Improve Self-Esteem: 8 Tips to Give You a Boost</a></strong></p><p>Herd mentality can also foster a sense of community. The Burning Man is an example of this positive side of mob mentality. This festival runs on cultural practices, often including community and art and follows ten main principles namely, radical inclusion, self-expression, self-reliance, communal effort, civic responsibility, gifting, decommodification, participation, immediacy and leaving no trace.</p><h4 class=wp-block-heading>How to avoid herd mentality?</h4><p>Despite having a few positive consequences, herd mentality does more harm than good. Therefore, it is important to resist the influence of the majority and maintain your individuality in your thoughts, beliefs and actions. Some strategies to help you think beyond herd mentality are as follows.&nbsp;</p><ul><li><strong>Cultivate self-awareness.</strong>&nbsp;This helps you establish a stronger sense of individual identity, thereby ensuring that more authentic decisions are made.&nbsp;</li><li><strong>Develop your <a href=#>confidence</a>.&nbsp;</strong>Just like building self-awareness, it is also imperative to strengthen your <a href=#>self-esteem</a> and self-efficacy.&nbsp;</li><li><strong>Embrace critical thinking.&nbsp;</strong>Ask questions about the behaviours, beliefs and thoughts. Weigh the pros and cons of the situation thoroughly before making a decision.&nbsp;</li><li><strong>Seek diverse perspectives.&nbsp;</strong>Sitting in your comfortable bubble is not going to help. You need to engage in conversations with people from different backgrounds, viewpoints, and experiences to gain a deeper understanding of the world and the issues it is facing.&nbsp;</li><li><strong>Be comfortable with uncertainty.&nbsp;</strong>Not following a certain group is an uncomfortable process and might also be lonely and uncertain. However, it is suggested that you stick to your values and stand by your own decisions, but at the same time welcome change in opinions as you go along.</li></ul><p><strong>Read More: <a href=#>Loneliness: Types, Impact and Strategies for Coping</a></strong></p><p>In conclusion, having one’s authentic thoughts and beliefs will help us make authentic decisions. It also helps us create a more inclusive and diverse community where decisions for the collective are made while respecting independent thought and personal autonomy.</p><span class=entry-categories><a href=# rel="category tag">Awareness</a></span><h4 class="entry-title title-animation-black-normal"><a href=#>Rising Back after SetBacks in Life</a></h4><i class="far fa-calendar-alt"></i>May 1, 2024 <span class=entry-categories><a href=# rel="category tag">Awareness</a></span><h4 class="entry-title title-animation-black-normal"><a href=#>Understanding correlation between attachment styles and life satisfaction:</a></h4><i class="far fa-calendar-alt"></i>April 30, 2024 <span class=entry-categories><a href=# rel="category tag">Awareness</a>, <a href=# rel="category tag">Education</a></span><h4 class="entry-title title-animation-black-normal"><a href=#>Navigating Life’s Transitions: Academics and Beyond</a></h4><i class="far fa-calendar-alt"></i>April 30, 2024 <span class=entry-categories><a href=# rel="category tag">Awareness</a></span><h4 class="entry-title title-animation-black-normal"><a href=#>Psychology behind Savings</a></h4><i class="far fa-calendar-alt"></i>April 29, 2024 <span class=entry-categories><a href=# rel="category tag">Awareness</a></span><h4 class="entry-title title-animation-black-normal"><a href=#>What is Languishing?</a></h4><i class="far fa-calendar-alt"></i>April 29, 2024<p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7sb%2FYnJ%2BopJ%2BcwG%2BvzqZmoaenYsGwecCvpqKcXZ2ys7CMppynrJGhtrXFjJqlnWWknbavt4yipZ2doJq7pbHNraOyZw%3D%3D</p><h4><i class="fas fa-share-alt" aria-hidden=true></i>&nbsp;Share!</h4><ul class=share-buttons><li><a href="https://www.facebook.com/sharer/sharer.php?u=%2fhow-to-avoid-herd-mentality-and-think-independently.html" target=_blank title="Share on Facebook"><i class="fab fa-facebook" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Share on Facebook</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="https://twitter.com/intent/tweet?source=%2fhow-to-avoid-herd-mentality-and-think-independently.html" target=_blank title=Tweet><i class="fab fa-twitter" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Tweet</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="https://plus.google.com/share?url=%2fhow-to-avoid-herd-mentality-and-think-independently.html" target=_blank title="Share on Google+"><i class="fab fa-google-plus" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Share on Google+</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="http://www.tumblr.com/share?v=3&u=%2fhow-to-avoid-herd-mentality-and-think-independently.html" target=_blank title="Post to Tumblr"><i class="fab fa-tumblr" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Post to Tumblr</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="http://pinterest.com/pin/create/button/?url=%2fhow-to-avoid-herd-mentality-and-think-independently.html" target=_blank title="Pin it"><i class="fab fa-pinterest-p" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Pin it</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="http://www.reddit.com/submit?url=%2fhow-to-avoid-herd-mentality-and-think-independently.html" target=_blank title="Submit to Reddit"><i class="fab fa-reddit-alien" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Submit to Reddit</span></a></li></ul><style>ul.share-buttons{list-style:none;padding:0}ul.share-buttons li{display:inline}ul.share-buttons .sr-only{position:absolute;clip:rect(1px 1px 1px 1px);clip:rect(1px,1px,1px,1px);padding:0;border:0;height:1px;width:1px;overflow:hidden}</style><div class="prev-next-post pure-g"><div class=pure-u-1-24 style=text-align:left><a href=./boot-windows-10-safe-mode.html><i class="fa fa-chevron-left"></i></a></div><div class=pure-u-10-24><nav class=prev><a href=./boot-windows-10-safe-mode.html>How to Boot in Safe Mode on Windows 10</a></nav></div><div class=pure-u-2-24>&nbsp;</div><div class=pure-u-10-24><nav class=next><a href=./china-manufacturing-stanley-black-decker-shuts-shenzhen.html>China manufacturing: Stanley Black &amp;amp; Decker shuts Shenzhen factory as costs soar</a></nav></div><div class=pure-u-1-24 style=text-align:right><a href=./china-manufacturing-stanley-black-decker-shuts-shenzhen.html><i class="fa fa-chevron-right"></i></a></div></div></div></div></div><script src=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/blackburn/js/ui.js></script>
