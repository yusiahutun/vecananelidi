In a special appearance in Season 16, Jeff proposed to Jordan, and the two ended up in Big Brother history.

The season 12 contestants Brendon Villegas and Rachel Reilly are happily married and have two children: Adora and Adler.</p><p>“Brendon told us he was a swim coach and I said, I’m never going to fall for this guy,” Rachel recalled in an interview with<a href=# data-type=URL data-id=https://www.eonline.com/news/1284732/why-big-brothers-rachel-reilly-and-brendon-villegas-will-have-you-rooting-for-more-showmances rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow"> E!

Even though I was liking her and thinking she was cool, I still was very scared to fall for someone inside this game. When we were put on the block, that’s what cemented it.”</p><p>They currently live in Alabama for Brendon’s latest medical residency at the University of Alabama at Birmingham.

I’m 34 years old. I’ve been there through three completely different parts of my life. Whether I want to accept it or deny it. This game is a huge part of my life. I met my husband there. It’s a huge part of my life and I just wish I could have taken one last lap around the house and just soaked it all in. I did that many times throughout the game. I appreciate it so much. I’m so thankful. I’m so honored to have been asked.

It makes it even better 🙏🏾,” Swaggy C wrote at the time on Instagram. “To Bay, I’m so blessed to have a kid with you. I love how open we are, how much we communicate, and everything we’ve been through. … HAPPY BIRTHDAY TO YOU.”</p><p>Despite connecting in the house, the two don’t plan to go back to reality TV. “I’m a multi-millionaire. I don’t need reality TV. People go on reality TV to get their first $500,000 or get their first million or get exposure. Some actually do it for the competition and the love of the game. I don’t love the game,” he shared in the video. “I’ve never watched&nbsp;The Challenge&nbsp;before I got on. … I don’t know who these people are.”</p></li><li class="pmc-fallback-list-item-wrap lrv-u-margin-b-2" readability=10.5><h2>Memphis Garrett & Christmas Abbott</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/stylecaster.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/memphis-garrett-christmas-abbott.png><p>Memphis Garrett and Christmas Abbott began their relationship after they competed on on season 22, “Big Brother: All-Stars.” The two confirmed their relationship to E! News and got married in May 2022.</p><p>“My favorite trait about Memphis is that he understands and knows exactly who I am,” Christmas shared with E! News. “He sees me and appreciates me for me and not who he thinks I should&nbsp;be, or who I have been in the past. He feels like my home. I also love his wild, unapologetic&nbsp;self. He is who he is.”</p><p>Memphis added, “The list could go on for days, but her contagious smile, unapologetic laugh and authenticity are just a few traits I love.”&nbsp;</p><p>“I really didn’t think that it would happen for me,” Christmas cibtubyed “I wasn’t looking for a relationship, I was there to WIN. It’s so wild to have this experience because we reverse engineered how society promotes falling in love. Memphis and I got to know one another through real conversations, building trust with each other and not starting with a physical connection.

That’s when I started really thinking like, ‘Wait a second, why didn’t this happen in the house? There’s such a strong connection and chemistry between us.’ I think that was the beginning of us thinking about what this could be.”</p><p>The two competed on The Amazing Race season 34 together.</p></li></ul><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmirpK65pq%2FArKueql6YvK57y6Kqratfl7aoecGrpq2glad6pLvUqaOeq12owaq4y2arqJ%2BVqbWmvo4%3D</p><h4><i class="fas fa-share-alt" aria-hidden=true></i>&nbsp;Share!</h4><ul class=share-buttons><li><a href="https://www.facebook.com/sharer/sharer.php?u=%2fbig-brother-couples-still-together.html" target=_blank title="Share on Facebook"><i class="fab fa-facebook" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Share on Facebook</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="https://twitter.com/intent/tweet?source=%2fbig-brother-couples-still-together.html" target=_blank title=Tweet><i class="fab fa-twitter" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Tweet</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="https://plus.google.com/share?url=%2fbig-brother-couples-still-together.html" target=_blank title="Share on Google+"><i class="fab fa-google-plus" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Share on Google+</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="http://www.tumblr.com/share?v=3&u=%2fbig-brother-couples-still-together.html" target=_blank title="Post to Tumblr"><i class="fab fa-tumblr" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Post to Tumblr</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="http://pinterest.com/pin/create/button/?url=%2fbig-brother-couples-still-together.html" target=_blank title="Pin it"><i class="fab fa-pinterest-p" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Pin it</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="http://www.reddit.com/submit?url=%2fbig-brother-couples-still-together.html" target=_blank title="Submit to Reddit"><i class="fab fa-reddit-alien" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Submit to Reddit</span></a></li></ul><style>ul.share-buttons{list-style:none;padding:0}ul.share-buttons li{display:inline}ul.share-buttons .sr-only{position:absolute;clip:rect(1px 1px 1px 1px);clip:rect(1px,1px,1px,1px);padding:0;border:0;height:1px;width:1px;overflow:hidden}</style><div class="prev-next-post pure-g"><div class=pure-u-1-24 style=text-align:left><a href=./inside-tiffany-trumps-lavish-upcoming-wedding-donald.html><i class="fa fa-chevron-left"></i></a></div><div class=pure-u-10-24><nav class=prev><a href=./inside-tiffany-trumps-lavish-upcoming-wedding-donald.html>Inside Tiffany Trumps lavish upcoming wedding: Donald Trump and Marla Maples daughter will wed</a></nav></div><div class=pure-u-2-24>&nbsp;</div><div class=pure-u-10-24><nav class=next><a href=./carlie-butler.html>Who is Carlie Butler dating?
