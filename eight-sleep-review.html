Sleep supplements abound in today's wellness arena and, while magnesium can soothe limbs that throb from a week of four-hour nights, no plant-derived wonder tonic has yet knocked me out cold until morning. Breathwork and meditation have proven similarly soothing, offering a balm for encroaching bedtime panic, but fail to actually keep me asleep. Add evening yoga, morning HIIT, home hypnotherapy and Headspace to the pile and, short of quick-fix (yet ill-advised) over-the-counter sleeping pills, the options run dry.</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=1 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">With <a href=# rel=nofollow data-vars-ga-outbound-link=https://yougov.co.uk/health/articles/42961-yougov-sleep-study-part-one-sleeping-patterns data-vars-ga-ux-element=Hyperlink data-vars-ga-call-to-action=Yougov data-vars-ga-product-id=655445fd-4e39-438b-8fc0-6c0a5ef09383 data-vars-ga-link-treatment="(not set) | (not set)" data-href=https://yougov.co.uk/health/articles/42961-yougov-sleep-study-part-one-sleeping-patterns data-product-url=https://yougov.co.uk/health/articles/42961-yougov-sleep-study-part-one-sleeping-patterns data-affiliate=true data-affiliate-url="https://go.redirectingat.com/?id=127X618962&url=https%3A%2F%2Fyougov.co.uk%2Fhealth%2Farticles%2F42961-yougov-sleep-study-part-one-sleeping-patterns" data-affiliate-network={} data-vars-ga-product-price=$0.00 data-vars-ga-product-retailer-id=e42ec420-1484-4442-8f40-45415090c45f class="body-link product-links css-1gunp80 e1aq0z090">Yougov</a> research finding that nine in ten Britons believe their quality of life would improve if they achieved more sleep, a solid night's rest has become the ultimate wellness win – and products that promise to optimise sleep quality are big business.

The brand’s dynamic Pod is the world's first responsive mattress topper, clinically shown to improve sleep quality by up to 32 per cent, allowing the body to recover up to 19 per cent more effectively. Indeed, the Pod has swiftly earned approval from people whom I would presume sleep really quite well, from gold-medal Olympians to biohacking scientists, tech CEOs (Zuckerberg and Musk rave about it), actors and world-travelling popstars – many of whom reportedly have their Pod installed in their hotel suites.<br></p><img alt="eight sleep" title="Eight Sleep " width=3128 height=2512 decoding=async data-nimg=1 sizes=100vw src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/hips.hearstapps.com/hmg-prod/images/eight-sleep-661558234921a.jpg style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center><p><span class="css-1urwh1q e1geg53v2">Courtesy Eight Sleep</span></p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=6 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">“When we first launched, no-one was talking about sleep – trackers were all about monitoring your fitness levels, but there was nothing out there addressing rest,” co-founder Alexandra Zatarain tells me over a caffeine-free herbal tea. “In the last five years we’ve seen a big shift where sleep has become the next big thing in health and wellness: and it makes sense. Sleep really is the most important factor in how you feel every day.”</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=7 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">The Pod is not a fast-track to blackout, but rather a sensitive feat of technology that responds to your temperature constantly throughout the night, working to keep you asleep for longer. And we’re not talking about a soporific doze either: the mattress works to hold you in the optimal states for rest and recovery as long as possible, meaning you benefit from an increase in both sleep duration and quality.</p><p><h2 class="css-1e8n84v e1bddzxd0">Eight Sleep Pod Cover 3</h2></p><a rel="nofollow noopener" href=# aria-label="£2,295 at eightsleep.com for Eight Sleep Pod Cover 3" data-href=https://www.eightsleep.com/uk/pod-cover/ data-product-url=https://www.eightsleep.com/uk/pod-cover/ data-affiliate=true data-affiliate-url="https://go.redirectingat.com/?id=127X618962&url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.eightsleep.com%2Fuk%2Fpod-cover%2F" data-affiliate-network={} data-vars-ga-call-to-action="£2,295 at eightsleep.com" data-vars-ga-media-role data-vars-ga-media-type="Single Product Embed" data-vars-ga-outbound-link=https://www.eightsleep.com/uk/pod-cover/ data-vars-ga-product-id=bf98a81a-3d60-402c-8d1e-6159ae7ba9bb data-vars-ga-product-price=£2,295.00 data-vars-ga-product-retailer-id=53d634e7-a7d7-4c2c-8978-7d1088d72604 data-vars-ga-link-treatment="(not set) | (not set)" class="product-image-link ebgq4gw0 e1b8bpvs0 css-15xslai e1c1bym14"><img alt="Eight Sleep Pod Cover 3" title="Eight Sleep Pod Cover 3" src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/hips.hearstapps.com/vader-prod.s3.amazonaws.com/1712314334-cover-square-p4_shadow_1.png width=8192 height=6283 decoding=async style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center></a><p><h2 class="css-1e8n84v e1bddzxd0">Eight Sleep Pod Cover 3</h2></p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=9 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">The Pod works on the basis that your temperature has a significant effect on your sleep, with many of us waking up when we feel too hot or too cold. Traditional mattresses and bedding trap heat, meaning your body is fighting against what is optimal for most of the night.</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=10 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">As CEO Matteo Franceschetti explains, “we all have a biological clock which affects our circadian rhythms. When we fall asleep, our temperature needs to drop, and in the first part of the night you need to be colder in order to get more deep sleep. In the second part of the night you need to be warmer to get more REM sleep. So, when you hear people saying ‘you should sleep at 68 degrees Fahrenheit’ – that’s too reductive. You need a temperature that changes with you throughout the night.”</p><h6 class="css-ok56rr e94w1mj3"><span aria-hidden=true class="css-0 eagam8p0"></span><span class="css-8lle59 e94w1mj1">Related Story</span><span aria-hidden=true class="css-0 eagam8p1"></span></h6><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=12 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">The science does stack up here: studies have found that the effects of being too hot or too cold during the night include increased wakefulness and a decrease in REM sleep and slow-wave sleep: so that’s both your sleep duration and sleep quality. With insomnia, both the onset (that’s trouble falling asleep) and maintenance (inability to stay asleep) subtypes are thought to be affected by temperature.</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=13 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">It’s not quite as simple as ensuring your room is heated to a comfortable point, either. The body’s thermoregulatory response may be innate, but it’s affected by a multitude of factors, from hormones and the menstrual cycle, to pregnancy, viral infections, autoimmune issues and age. Even the time you hit the gym and what you ate for dinner can affect your temperature. By supporting natural thermoregulation during sleep, the Pod is able to prevent waking and keep you comfortable until your natural wake time.</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=14 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">So, what exactly is it? This high-tech mattress cover is embedded with 20 sensors and threaded with what the brand calls an ‘active grid’ - a water-based temperature-management framework that can heat (to 43 degrees) and cool (right down to 13 degrees) the cover and therefore your body in response to fluctuations in your temperature, which it monitors constantly. It also keeps track of your respiratory rate, heart rate and movement throughout the night, with 99 per cent accuracy that matches leading wearables, such as the Oura. Cleverly, each side of the bed is independently controlled, so you and your partner can set individual preferences.</p><h6 class="css-ok56rr e94w1mj3"><span aria-hidden=true class="css-0 eagam8p0"></span><span class="css-8lle59 e94w1mj1">Related Story</span><span aria-hidden=true class="css-0 eagam8p1"></span></h6><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=16 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">All of this data is broken down in a connected smartphone app (which comes at an additional cost of £14 per month). Here, you can see your sleep cycle broken into light, deep and REM sleep, track any wake-ups, and adjust the autopilot’s temperature settings to keep you as comfortable as possible.<br></p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=17 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">So far, so impressive – but the brand isn't finished yet. “Our long-term vision is actually to work on compressing sleep: what if you could sleep only six hours and get more rest than when you were sleeping eight hours?” asks Franceschetti. “You’d get two hours of life back.”</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=18 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">“However long you’re sleeping, 20 per cent of that time is ideally deep sleep and 25 per cent is REM – the rest is light sleep,” he explains. “Almost all of the benefits come from deep and REM sleep: the rest is really quite inefficient. So, our goal is to further compress that light sleep, meaning you could potentially sleep for two hours less a night and still get the same amount of beneficial rest. It’s all about the quality, not the quantity.”</p><h2 data-node-id=20 class="body-h2 css-p3fpzg emevuu60"><strong>The Eight Sleep Pod: The Bazaar Review</strong></h2><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=21 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">Initially, the idea of scrutinising my sleep success in pursuit of optimisation made me nervous: as someone who struggles with the basic act of staying asleep, I wasn’t jumping at the chance to be constantly reminded of my failures. However, I was intrigued by Eight Sleep’s promise to not just track my sleep or knock me clean out, but lull me into better rest without chemical interference.</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=22 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">I tried the Pod 3, which is the third-gen, most advanced model. It’s admittedly weighty: I did wrestle with it for quite some time, although the app led me through the set-up with crystal-clear instructions. The cover is connected to a control box that hosts the water tank, and while I was initially sceptical about how this would look in my tech-free bedroom, it does slot unobtrusively into the corner.</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=23 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">Once the topper is tucked neatly beneath your sheets, the experience is slicker than anything else I’ve tried in the wellness-tech realm. The app is fast, polished and brilliantly informative, cutting out superfluous data and irritating notifications in favour of clear, actionable insights.</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=24 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">Of course, the golden question is: am I actually sleeping better? While it took a few nights to get to grips with my preferred temperatures – the autopilot algorithm initially took things too chilly, which had me waking up in search of a jumper at 2am – I am genuinely stunned at how much my sleep has improved. Nothing has had this kind of effect on my tumultuous nights.</p><h6 class="css-ok56rr e94w1mj3"><span aria-hidden=true class="css-0 eagam8p0"></span><span class="css-8lle59 e94w1mj1">Related Story</span><span aria-hidden=true class="css-0 eagam8p1"></span></h6><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=26 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">Within seven days, I found I was sleeping soundly throughout the night much more often than usual, and on nights when I did wake to go to the bathroom or drink some water, I managed to fall back asleep instantly, rather than sitting upright in a state of crescendoing panic until sunrise. After a fortnight, the app has awarded me a ‘sleep fitness’ score of 100 per cent, and both my mood and energy levels are transformed.</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=27 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">I was also surprised at how helpful I found the optimisation data in the app. While I know that my insomnia tracks alongside my hormonal cycle – wide-awake nights are my dominating PMS symptom – there are other factors that feed into my sleep quality. The app allows you to track everything from sugar and alcohol consumption to exercise, screen time and sickness, allowing you to learn which factors have a significant effect on your sleep quality, enabling beneficial lifestyle changes rather than optimistic stabs in the dark. (Yes, I do need to quash that mid-week glass of wine.)</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=28 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">My partner – an enviably brilliant sleeper – has also noticed welcome benefits while using the Pod. Besides crowning it the only piece of wellness tech to which I’ve subjected him that he would happily keep hold of (the sofa-sized <a href=# data-vars-ga-outbound-link=https://www.harpersbazaar.com/uk/beauty/a29497506/best-led-face-mask/ data-vars-ga-ux-element=Hyperlink data-vars-ga-call-to-action=LED class="body-link css-1gunp80 emevuu60">LED</a> panel didn’t go down quite as well) he reported waking up feeling deeply rested, with a clearer head throughout the day and boundless energy come the weekend. As it turns out, a good night’s sleep really is priceless – or rather, it’s £2300.</p><h6 class="css-ok56rr e94w1mj3"><span aria-hidden=true class="css-0 eagam8p0"></span><span class="css-8lle59 e94w1mj1">Related Story</span><span aria-hidden=true class="css-0 eagam8p1"></span></h6><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7qa3RqZyrq5KWx6Kt0WeaqKVfqrhwrsSarK2xX6K2r7CMm6adsV%2BWg3GAj25rcWpfmraotNNmqqWdlaV6s7HVopywZw%3D%3D</p><h4><i class="fas fa-share-alt" aria-hidden=true></i>&nbsp;Share!</h4><ul class=share-buttons><li><a href="https://www.facebook.com/sharer/sharer.php?u=%2feight-sleep-review.html" target=_blank title="Share on Facebook"><i class="fab fa-facebook" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Share on Facebook</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="https://twitter.com/intent/tweet?source=%2feight-sleep-review.html" target=_blank title=Tweet><i class="fab fa-twitter" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Tweet</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="https://plus.google.com/share?url=%2feight-sleep-review.html" target=_blank title="Share on Google+"><i class="fab fa-google-plus" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Share on Google+</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="http://www.tumblr.com/share?v=3&u=%2feight-sleep-review.html" target=_blank title="Post to Tumblr"><i class="fab fa-tumblr" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Post to Tumblr</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="http://pinterest.com/pin/create/button/?url=%2feight-sleep-review.html" target=_blank title="Pin it"><i class="fab fa-pinterest-p" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Pin it</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="http://www.reddit.com/submit?url=%2feight-sleep-review.html" target=_blank title="Submit to Reddit"><i class="fab fa-reddit-alien" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Submit to Reddit</span></a></li></ul><style>ul.share-buttons{list-style:none;padding:0}ul.share-buttons li{display:inline}ul.share-buttons .sr-only{position:absolute;clip:rect(1px 1px 1px 1px);clip:rect(1px,1px,1px,1px);padding:0;border:0;height:1px;width:1px;overflow:hidden}</style><div class="prev-next-post pure-g"><div class=pure-u-1-24 style=text-align:left><a href=./khloe-kardashian-good-american-jeans-sale.html><i class="fa fa-chevron-left"></i></a></div><div class=pure-u-10-24><nav class=prev><a href=./khloe-kardashian-good-american-jeans-sale.html>Khlo Kardashian's waist-shaping Good American jeans are 50% off right now</a></nav></div><div class=pure-u-2-24>&nbsp;</div><div class=pure-u-10-24><nav class=next><a href=./howard-industries-donates-food-toys-to-salvation-army.html>Howard Industries donates food, toys to Salvation Army | Business</a></nav></div><div class=pure-u-1-24 style=text-align:right><a href=./howard-industries-donates-food-toys-to-salvation-army.html><i class="fa fa-chevron-right"></i></a></div></div></div></div></div><script src=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/blackburn/js/ui.js></script>
