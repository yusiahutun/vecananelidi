Simpson. The deaths of Nicole Brown Simpson and Ronald Goldman, and the media circus they provoked, marked a cynical coming-of-age for American culture that reverberates more than two decades later. That explains the anticipation for next Tuesday’s FX premiere of <i>The People v. O.J. Simpson: American Crime Story</i>, which purports to further vivify a true-crime saga that was documented unrelentingly as it unfolded — and, naturally, beguile us with a cast cannily top-billed by names like John Travolta (as Simpson’s defense attorney, Robert Shapiro) and Cuba Gooding Jr. (as the football star turned actor turned disgraced accused killer).</p><p class=clay-paragraph data-editable=text data-uri=www.vulture.com/_components/clay-paragraph/instances/ambrose-f915967c58dbe16d376a008f382a24af-2-0-1@published data-word-count=68>During the intervening years since Simpson’s original acquittal, the story never really ended. Brown Simpson and Goldman’s loved ones continued to publicly grieve and fight for justice. O.J., meanwhile, resumed life in infamy until running into legal trouble he couldn’t escape. In 2008, following a robbery at gunpoint in Las Vegas, Simpson was convicted of more than a dozen felonious charges and currently resides in a Nevada prison.</p><p class=clay-paragraph data-editable=text data-uri=www.vulture.com/_components/clay-paragraph/instances/ambrose-f915967c58dbe16d376a008f382a24af-2-0-2@published data-word-count=56>In an effort to help separate fact from fiction heading into <i>People v. O.J.</i>, and offer some insight into how the man <i>Playboy </i>once called the “best-liked football player ever” hastened his demise and altered so many lives, below is a timeline of Simpson’s run-ins with the law from more than 50 years ago through today.</p><p class=clay-paragraph data-editable=text data-uri=www.vulture.com/_components/clay-paragraph/instances/ambrose-f915967c58dbe16d376a008f382a24af-3-0-0@published data-word-count=56><b>Early 1960s (Exact Year Unknown)</b><br>While leader of a San Francisco youth gang dubbed the Persian Warriors, a<a href=#> 16-year-old Simpson gets busted</a> for fighting (though some friends have said it was petty thievery) and spends several days in juvenile detention.

The reports noted that she suffered from extensive bruising and scratching and required hospital treatment, and quoted Nicole as pleading with officers, “He’s going to kill me. He’s going to kill me. You never do anything about him. You talk to him and then leave.” Simpson pled no contest and was punished with community service, probation, and fines.
