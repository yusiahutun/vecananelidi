This is his life’s focus, and his devotion to charity is at the very core of the principles he lives by, and is obvious through the impact and success of his many charitable projects throughout the UK and beyond.</p><p class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">“To this point, it is deeply offensive to today see false claims made about The Duke of Sussex and his charitable work. It is both defamatory and insulting to all the outstanding organisations and people he has partnered with.</p><p class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">“Travalyst (which was founded within Sussex Royal) is a non-profit organisation for which The Duke receives no commercial or financial gain, as is the case with all of his charitable commitments. The Duke has not, nor has he ever, had any personal financial interest in his charitable work. The interest has always been clear: to support others and to make a positive difference.</p><p class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">“Had the appropriate course of action been followed for these false allegations, it would have clearly demonstrated that anything related to Sussex Royal, Travalyst, or any of the Duke’s charitable endeavours is transparent and above board. To suggest otherwise is unequivocally wrong and will be acted upon accordingly with the weight of the law. The avenue through which this was publicly and salaciously created only suggests a hunger for media attention as well as a shared and attacking agenda, which is neither right nor just.</p><p class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">“Both The Charity Commission’s own statement today, as well as that of The Royal Foundation, state there is no determination of wrongdoing here. All of The Duke’s charitable activities are fully transparent as well as compliant with Charity Commission guidelines, and moreover with his own moral compass.”</p><h2 data-node-id=6 class="body-h3 css-11vz3s8 emevuu60">Original Story 7/20/20:</h2><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=7 class="body-dropcap css-803sjt emevuu60">Princes Harry and William have been reported to a charity watchdog organization for the alleged mishandling of donated funds following Harry's professional split from The Royal Foundation.</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=8 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">According to <a href=# data-vars-ga-outbound-link=https://www.newsweek.com/prince-harry-prince-william-reported-inappropriate-use-over-350000-1519046 data-vars-ga-ux-element=Hyperlink data-vars-ga-call-to-action=Newsweek class="body-link css-1gunp80 emevuu60">Newsweek</a>, an anti-monarchy group called Republic is accusing the two royals of "putting their relationship above the interests of Sussex Royal and The Royal Foundation." Following the decision for the brothers to split the Royal Foundation's funds, with some going to Harry and Duchess Meghan's now-defunct Sussex Royal foundation, Republic is calling out the usage of more than $350,000 that were transferred to Harry's eco-travel venture, Travalyst, when the couple were forced to close Sussex Royal.</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=9 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">Harry's representatives have since addressed any speculation regarding the mishandling of Sussex Royal funds, however, claiming that Travalyst does serve as an organization that promotes sustainability and would therefore be considered an organization that promotes the mission of the previous Sussex Royal foundation.</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=10 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">“Grants made to the non-profit organization Travalyst are for the ongoing development of projects that will support communities, wildlife, and the environment through sustainable travel and tourism. All grants have been made impartially and objectively, fully in line with governance requirements, and have been reported transparently in full accordance with regulations," said a spokesperson who worked with Sussex Royal.</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=11 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">Harry and Meghan's Sussex Royal was active for a year before the couple <a href=# data-vars-ga-outbound-link=https://www.harpersbazaar.com/celebrity/latest/a30445491/meghan-markle-prince-harry-step-down-royal-family/ data-vars-ga-ux-element=Hyperlink data-vars-ga-call-to-action="stepped down from their roles" class="body-link css-1gunp80 emevuu60">stepped down from their roles</a> as senior working members of the royal family.
