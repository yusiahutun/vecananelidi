The 34-years-old, who works as a day trader, signed up for MAFS because he wanted “a best friend, partner, and somebody to explore the whole world with.” “I was feeling lonely and definitely wanted to find a perfect match to do life with,” Nate shared with In Touch Weekly ahead of the show’s premiere.</p><p>Attraction will play a major factor in how the eight-week experiment plays out, the day trader shared.

She also shared a story from one of her dates that ultimately made her refuse to settle. She said, “While on a date, I was told to Cash App him my portion of money for the date. From there I was done.”</p><p>The MAFS star also shared that she did not have any fears going into the show. “If it didn’t work out between me and my husband then that’s OK, we go our separate ways. I go back to living a dope life single.” Stacia told.</p><p>Despite knowing what to expect from the marriage experiment, Stacia shared feeling nervous going to the actual wedding day. “I have the sweats… I wanna throw up, pass out…just wanna get this over with and meet my husband,” Stacia recalled her wedding day during a chat with Entertainment Tonight.</p><p>While both Stacia and Nate fancy different qualities (or traits) from their perfect one, the hopeful couples are on the same page when it comes to their strong desire for family. Coming from single-parent households, both want a partner to create unforgettable experiences with. “Being able to create memories. Being able to have a partner that I could just do this crazy experiment with that was as crazy as I was,” Stacia told In Touch Weekly.</p><p>As of this writing, we did not know if the two are still together.
