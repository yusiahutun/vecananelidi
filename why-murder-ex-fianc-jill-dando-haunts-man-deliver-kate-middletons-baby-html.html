When she was killed 19 months later, the doctor overcame his grief by ignoring friends' advice to 'take three months off' and instead plunged himself into his work, often operating late into the evening.<br></span></p><p><span>The result is a burgeoning private&nbsp; and NHS practice in London’s leading hospitals, as well as rooms in Harley Street, and the onerous responsibility of delivering the Royal Family’s babies for the next decade or two.<br></span></p><p><span>He has also found domestic happiness. Four years ago he married Dr Janet Stowell, 35, whom he met in 2003 when she was a young house doctor at St Mary’s, Paddington. They live in St John’s Wood, London in a detached £3million house, and have a two-year-old son.<br></span></p><p><span>'Alan is incredibly contented with life - he's never been a complex man,' says a colleague. 'He loves his family, and he loves his work - it was just the same when he was with Jill, total dedication.'<br></span></p><p><span>There is one area, however, in which Alan Farthing can never find total peace: the fact that Jill's killer has never been found. Not only does the crime remain unsolved, but despite umpteen theories, no clear motive has ever emerged.</span></p><img src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/i.dailymail.co.uk/i/pix/2012/12/08/article-0-16628BAC000005DC-356_634x478.jpg height=478 width=634 alt="The Duchess of Cambridge pictured leaving King Edward Vll Hospital in Central London on Thursday, with Prince William, after suffering acute morning sickness" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto><p class=imageCaption>The Duchess of Cambridge pictured leaving King Edward Vll Hospital in Central London on Thursday, with Prince William, after suffering acute morning sickness</p><p><span>Farthing himself was extensively interviewed by Detective Inspector Hamish Campbell and his team as they cast round in all directions to find a motive for the killing of television’s ultimate 'girl next door'.<br></span></p><p><span>What they hoped to find from the handsome, despairing doctor were possible pointers to previous relationships where jealousy might have been turned into obsession by his very public engagement to Jill. His job as a gynaecologist inevitably raised further questions of potential secret passions and the unrequited love of female patients.<br></span></p><p><span>To Farthing, a man dedicated to bringing life into the world, the death of his famous fiancée meant he was swept up into a surreal nightmare.<br></span></p><p><span>Until that moment, everything about his life had been so conventional - a bright boy educated at Queen Elizabeth Grammar School in Wimborne, Dorset, where his father, a former research doctor, was headmaster; qualifying as a doctor at St George’s Hospital, Tooting; having an extrovert brother, Mark, who became a nurse and paramedic and is now a manager in the West Midlands ambulance service; and poignantly, a sister, Carol, whose daughter Naomi, now 20, was so excited at the prospect of being one of Jill Dando’s bridesmaids at the wedding fixed for September 25, 1999.<br></span></p><img src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/i.dailymail.co.uk/i/pix/2012/12/04/article-2242878-16552950000005DC-336_306x423.jpg height=423 width=306 alt="Britain's Prince William and Catherine, the Duke and Duchess of Cambridge before the London Olympic Games 2012 Opening Ceremony at the Olympic Stadium" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto> <img src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/i.dailymail.co.uk/i/pix/2012/12/04/article-2242878-16577CC4000005DC-457_306x423.jpg height=423 width=306 alt="Outside: Members of the media gather as a policeman stands guard at King Edward VII Hospital in London" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto><p class=imageCaption>Expectations: The Duke and Duchess of Cambridge pictured at the London 2012 Olympics (left), and King Edward VII Hospital in Marylebone, central London, where Kate is being treated (right)</p><p><span>Jill was the West Country girl who went to comprehensive school in Weston-super-Mare and left with two A-levels to work on a local newspaper. By the time she arrived on television, she was dazzling networks with her pulling power and entranced viewers not with professional slickness, but an engaging modesty.<br></span></p><p><span>She and Farthing, a year her junior, met on a blind date at a dinner party in October 1997.<br></span></p><p><span>'We hit it off and very quickly fell in love,' he said when giving evidence at Barry George's first trial. Sixteen months later, on January 31, 1999, at a hastily-assembled party in Chiswick, West London, Farthing hushed guests including Sir Cliff Richard, Nick Ross (Jill’s co-presenter on Crimewatch), Anna Ford and Jill’s other BBC friends including newsreaders Michael Buerk and Martyn Lewis, and announced: 'We’re engaged.'<br></span></p><p><span>The £20,000 diamond solitaire ring he gave Jill that night was on her finger when the killer struck three months later.<br></span></p><p><span>The details surrounding that devastating Monday morning have been well told. Jill had spent the weekend at Alan’s home in Chiswick, made breakfast and driven to the shops in Hammersmith to buy an ink cartridge and two Dover sole. Then she headed for her own home barely a mile away in Gowan Avenue, Fulham. It was 11.30am.<br></span></p><p><span>Waiting there was her killer. The shooting was swift and executed with chilling skill.<br></span></p><p><span>As she was about to put her key into the front door lock the gunman gripped her by an arm (bruises showed up under ultraviolet examination), forced her head down almost to the ground, and shot her through the temple with a 9mm handgun, the classic contract murder weapon.</span></p><span></span><p><span>There were various sightings of a tall, white man running away, a sweating man getting on a bus, a dark blue Range Rover hovering in the vicinity and so on.<br></span></p><p><span>Det Insp Hamish Campbell had 42 detectives looking for the killer and examining possible motives. One was that the killing was a vengeance attack on the BBC by Serbian terrorists in response to Nato’s attack on the Belgrade TV station.<br></span></p><p><span>Another was that criminals 'fingered' by Crimewatch had exacted revenge (underworld figures let it be known they were 'deeply insulted' that anyone would think they would do such a thing).<br></span></p><p><span>A bungling mugger or a burglar? He never snatched her valuable engagement ring, and, besides, the killing was far too expert for that.<br></span></p><p><span>Money? She left no will and her £1million estate went to her elderly father.<br></span></p><p><span>This left detectives looking for clues from the men in her life, including the devastated Farthing, of course. Not that they were personally seen as suspects, but because of the potential for resentment and hatred that can be so easily kindled by a lost lover or broken romance.<br></span></p><p><span>There were five men who figured seriously in Jill Dando’s life - not an excessive number for a modern, single woman of 37.<br></span></p><p><span>None of these inquiries led anywhere. And then Barry George, very much a local character, was arrested after one of the biggest murder inquiries in Britain.<br></span></p><p><span>In court, the prosecution claimed George was obsessed with celebrities and guns and the jury heard from a series of women who claimed to have been approached by him. A tiny speck of gunpowder residue found in his pocket was central to his original conviction.<br></span></p><p><span>Case solved? Far from it.<br></span></p><p><span>For Alan Farthing, the conviction and imprisonment of George in July, 2001, and his subsequent acquittal after scientific evidence was discredited and ruled inadmissible by the judge, have all been part of the extraordinary emotional switchback he has had to endure.<br></span></p><p><span>An intensely private man, Farthing surprised friends by asking to be the chairman of the Jill Dando Fund, which was set up a year after her murder. It raised £1.5million, and he stood down as soon as it was handed over to University College London, where the Jill Dando Institute of Crime Science was established, and now runs, under the chairmanship of Nick Ross.<br></span></p><p><span>Were it not for Alan Farthing's cautious and decent nature, that sum, it is believed, could have been very much more.<br></span></p><p><span>'The first anniversary of its establishment,' says one involved figure, 'was a huge opportunity to raise more money and we wanted a big launch with forget-me-nots (the fund’s symbol) at check-outs of all the major supermarkets. We could have made many millions that day. But Alan was against it.<br></span></p><p><span>'He’s rather conservative in his ways, and he thought that sort of thing was rather unseemly.'<br></span></p><p><span>According to one friend, it 'took Alan a very long time after Jill's death for him to even think of seeing anyone else seriously. That’s probably why he was seeing Janet for five years before they married. They're very happy'.<br></span></p><p><span>Janet has introduced Farthing into a world very different from the one he got to know with Jill Dando. Her solo violinist father, Professor Robin Stowell, is an authority on ancient music.<br></span></p><p><span>But he's back on familiar ground with her brother David, once a professional football triallist and now a presenter on Manchester United’s own television channel MUTV.<br></span></p><p><span>This Christmas he will, as always, be exchanging cards with Jill Dando's brother Nigel, a presenter on BBC Radio Bristol.<br></span></p><p><span>'Alan would never lose touch with Jill's family,' says a close figure. 'They will always share the same frustration, not only that her killer remains at large but that they still don't know why on earth somebody would want to kill her.'<br></span></p><p><span>The world moves on, however.</span></p><p><span>Indeed, it offers a remarkable symmetry. The doctor whose fiancée was once believed to have been murdered by a man said to be obsessed by Princess Diana is now preparing to deliver the princess’s first grandchild.</span></p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7pa3IpbCmmZmhe6S7ja6iaKaVrMBwrdGtoJyklWJ%2Fc4CTcmhpZ4edxm651KubnqpdmsVussiapZxlep65rXmjmqWdp12drra606xkppmeYrGmuMivnKtle5bBpnmsopudpJWpvK%2B%2FjJuYm7FencGuuA%3D%3D</p><h4><i class="fas fa-share-alt" aria-hidden=true></i>&nbsp;Share!</h4><ul class=share-buttons><li><a href="https://www.facebook.com/sharer/sharer.php?u=%2fwhy-murder-ex-fianc-jill-dando-haunts-man-deliver-kate-middletons-baby-html.html" target=_blank title="Share on Facebook"><i class="fab fa-facebook" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Share on Facebook</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="https://twitter.com/intent/tweet?source=%2fwhy-murder-ex-fianc-jill-dando-haunts-man-deliver-kate-middletons-baby-html.html" target=_blank title=Tweet><i class="fab fa-twitter" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Tweet</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="https://plus.google.com/share?url=%2fwhy-murder-ex-fianc-jill-dando-haunts-man-deliver-kate-middletons-baby-html.html" target=_blank title="Share on Google+"><i class="fab fa-google-plus" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Share on Google+</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="http://www.tumblr.com/share?v=3&u=%2fwhy-murder-ex-fianc-jill-dando-haunts-man-deliver-kate-middletons-baby-html.html" target=_blank title="Post to Tumblr"><i class="fab fa-tumblr" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Post to Tumblr</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="http://pinterest.com/pin/create/button/?url=%2fwhy-murder-ex-fianc-jill-dando-haunts-man-deliver-kate-middletons-baby-html.html" target=_blank title="Pin it"><i class="fab fa-pinterest-p" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Pin it</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="http://www.reddit.com/submit?url=%2fwhy-murder-ex-fianc-jill-dando-haunts-man-deliver-kate-middletons-baby-html.html" target=_blank title="Submit to Reddit"><i class="fab fa-reddit-alien" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Submit to Reddit</span></a></li></ul><style>ul.share-buttons{list-style:none;padding:0}ul.share-buttons li{display:inline}ul.share-buttons .sr-only{position:absolute;clip:rect(1px 1px 1px 1px);clip:rect(1px,1px,1px,1px);padding:0;border:0;height:1px;width:1px;overflow:hidden}</style><div class="prev-next-post pure-g"><div class=pure-u-1-24 style=text-align:left><a href=./find-out-how-monica-potter-turned-her-lavish-house-into-a-loving-home-53822.html><i class="fa fa-chevron-left"></i></a></div><div class=pure-u-10-24><nav class=prev><a href=./find-out-how-monica-potter-turned-her-lavish-house-into-a-loving-home-53822.html>Find Out How Monica Potter Turned Her Lavish House Into a Loving Home</a></nav></div><div class=pure-u-2-24>&nbsp;</div><div class=pure-u-10-24><nav class=next><a href=./nine-year-old-girl-killed-crash-minutes-taking-day-school-picture-html.html>Nine-year-old girl killed in crash minutesafter taking her first day of school picture</a></nav></div><div class=pure-u-1-24 style=text-align:right><a href=./nine-year-old-girl-killed-crash-minutes-taking-day-school-picture-html.html><i class="fa fa-chevron-right"></i></a></div></div></div></div></div><script src=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/blackburn/js/ui.js></script>
