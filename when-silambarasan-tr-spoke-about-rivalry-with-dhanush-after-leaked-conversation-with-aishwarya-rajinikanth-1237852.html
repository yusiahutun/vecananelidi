A recorded conversation that supposedly took place between Simbu and Aishwarya was leaked online. It was said that they were dating each other. The conversation was quite abusive in nature and several said that it was fake.</p><h2><strong>Simbu&nbsp;and Dhanush became rivals after a leaked conversation with Aishwarya Rajinikanth&nbsp;</strong></h2><p>Ever since then, there have been rumors that <a href=# onclick='triggerArticleInterlinkClick("article_interlink_click","When Silambarasan TR spoke about rivalry with Dhanush after leaked conversation with Aishwarya Rajinikanth ","1237852","https://www.pinkvilla.com/celebrity/dhanush","articlepage","/entertainment/south/when-silambarasan-tr-spoke-about-rivalry-with-dhanush-after-leaked-conversation-with-aishwarya-rajinikanth-1237852","Dhanush ","Body_Hyperlink","entertainment","south")'>Dhanush </a>tried to stop Simbu's career in the Tamil film industry. However, in 2017, Simbu and Dhanush publicly spoke about their rivalry when they shared the stage at the audio launch of actor Santhanamâ€™s Sakka Podu Podu Raja. He called the 3 actor&nbsp;a very good friend and said they have no issues between them. He said, "Many people think that Dhanush is my rival and we have issues between us. Frankly speaking, it is not true. I am a jolly man and everyone knows about me. Dhanush is a good friend. We interact well and there are no issues between us."</p><span class=f14>Advertisement</span><p>Addressing the rumors of their rivalry, the Pathu Thala actor admitted Dhanush is his opponent and competitor. Simbu said, "Friendship is different and cinema is different. When it comes to our profession, he is my opponent. I fight against them in cinema, which is how we can grow. When his Polladhavan became a hit, I don't know whether he was happy or not, but I felt happy because it inspired me to give a bigger hit than that. And when my film becomes successful, it should motivate him to do a better film than mine."</p><h3><strong>Simbu's downhill career</strong></h3><p>Back then, because of rivalry and controversies, Silambarasan TR had a very rough phase in his career. He had to face multiple flops and several films faced issues. In 2021, Simbu underwent a massive transformation and decided to restart his career with a different approach. And from then, the rest is history. He has delivered blockbusters like Eeswaran, Maanadu, and Vendhu Thanindhathu Kaadu.&nbsp;<br>.</p><p class=also_read_style><strong>ALSO READ:</strong>&nbsp;<a href=# onclick='triggerCommentfollowAlsoClick("article_also_read_click","When Silambarasan TR spoke about rivalry with Dhanush after leaked conversation with Aishwarya Rajinikanth ",1237852,"https://www.pinkvilla.com/entertainment/south/did-you-know-rajinikanth-was-once-told-to-quit-fighting-in-movies-1237840","articlepage","/entertainment/south/when-silambarasan-tr-spoke-about-rivalry-with-dhanush-after-leaked-conversation-with-aishwarya-rajinikanth-1237852","Content Also read","entertainment","south"),triggerArticleInterlinkClick("article_interlink_click","When Silambarasan TR spoke about rivalry with Dhanush after leaked conversation with Aishwarya Rajinikanth ",1237852,"https://www.pinkvilla.com/entertainment/south/did-you-know-rajinikanth-was-once-told-to-quit-fighting-in-movies-1237840","articlepage","/entertainment/south/when-silambarasan-tr-spoke-about-rivalry-with-dhanush-after-leaked-conversation-with-aishwarya-rajinikanth-1237852","Did you know Rajinikanth was once told to quit fighting in movies?","Also_Read","entertainment","south")'><strong>Did you know Rajinikanth was once told to quit fighting in movies?</strong></a></p><span class=f14>Advertisement</span><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7sbXNpK2ipJyWe6S7zGicp6yVp8Gitc2mnKesX6i8tsDHaK6hnZ5iwKq4wKaZmqqRqK6vedOrZKyon6Cybq3BqKytZaKew6K40bJksKGknXqltMCnrKygXZaztbHRZqOemZuasW6vzqetnqqjlsGqu81mrqKsmGKuqr%2FHsJirsZFiv6K2yKegpJmeqbVufZFsbnFtYg%3D%3D</p><h4><i class="fas fa-share-alt" aria-hidden=true></i>&nbsp;Share!</h4><ul class=share-buttons><li><a href="https://www.facebook.com/sharer/sharer.php?u=%2fwhen-silambarasan-tr-spoke-about-rivalry-with-dhanush-after-leaked-conversation-with-aishwarya-rajinikanth-1237852.html" target=_blank title="Share on Facebook"><i class="fab fa-facebook" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Share on Facebook</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="https://twitter.com/intent/tweet?source=%2fwhen-silambarasan-tr-spoke-about-rivalry-with-dhanush-after-leaked-conversation-with-aishwarya-rajinikanth-1237852.html" target=_blank title=Tweet><i class="fab fa-twitter" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Tweet</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="https://plus.google.com/share?url=%2fwhen-silambarasan-tr-spoke-about-rivalry-with-dhanush-after-leaked-conversation-with-aishwarya-rajinikanth-1237852.html" target=_blank title="Share on Google+"><i class="fab fa-google-plus" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Share on Google+</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="http://www.tumblr.com/share?v=3&u=%2fwhen-silambarasan-tr-spoke-about-rivalry-with-dhanush-after-leaked-conversation-with-aishwarya-rajinikanth-1237852.html" target=_blank title="Post to Tumblr"><i class="fab fa-tumblr" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Post to Tumblr</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="http://pinterest.com/pin/create/button/?url=%2fwhen-silambarasan-tr-spoke-about-rivalry-with-dhanush-after-leaked-conversation-with-aishwarya-rajinikanth-1237852.html" target=_blank title="Pin it"><i class="fab fa-pinterest-p" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Pin it</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="http://www.reddit.com/submit?url=%2fwhen-silambarasan-tr-spoke-about-rivalry-with-dhanush-after-leaked-conversation-with-aishwarya-rajinikanth-1237852.html" target=_blank title="Submit to Reddit"><i class="fab fa-reddit-alien" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Submit to Reddit</span></a></li></ul><style>ul.share-buttons{list-style:none;padding:0}ul.share-buttons li{display:inline}ul.share-buttons .sr-only{position:absolute;clip:rect(1px 1px 1px 1px);clip:rect(1px,1px,1px,1px);padding:0;border:0;height:1px;width:1px;overflow:hidden}</style><div class="prev-next-post pure-g"><div class=pure-u-1-24 style=text-align:left><a href=./best-tummy-flattering-dresses-for-women.html><i class="fa fa-chevron-left"></i></a></div><div class=pure-u-10-24><nav class=prev><a href=./best-tummy-flattering-dresses-for-women.html>13 stylish tummy flattering dresses: Expert stylist advice &amp;amp; tips on the best styles to wear</a></nav></div><div class=pure-u-2-24>&nbsp;</div><div class=pure-u-10-24><nav class=next><a href=./top-10-what-best-thing-about-your-neighbourhood-and-why.html>Top 10: What is the best thing about your neighbourhood, and why? - YP</a></nav></div><div class=pure-u-1-24 style=text-align:right><a href=./top-10-what-best-thing-about-your-neighbourhood-and-why.html><i class="fa fa-chevron-right"></i></a></div></div></div></div></div><script src=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/blackburn/js/ui.js></script>
