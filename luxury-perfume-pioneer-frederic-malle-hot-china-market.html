<time>13 Apr 2024, 00:00</time></div></div><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">Instead of keeping them hidden behind the scenes, Malle put their names front and centre on the bottles of his fragrances, which include the iconic Portrait of a Lady, created with Dominique Ropion, and Musc Ravageur, made with Maurice Roucel.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/cdn.i-scmp.com/sites/default/files/d8/images/canvas/2022/08/09/d6af4b80-3e41-49d5-858a-8c8aa1ae8ac6_686e78c9.jpg><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">“In those days people tended to do mass-market perfumes or perfumes that pretended to be old as if there was no quality in new, modern fragrances,” Malle says.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">“So my idea was first and foremost to prove that perfumery was still alive, and just like in contemporary art [where] you could still paint and be a great painter, so I got the best perfumers in the industry to work with me because I always considered them as much artists as designers of any kind.”</p><h3 type=h3 data-qa=Component-Component class="e14khtrb0 css-17x7qa9 e793b7w1"><a class="link-text css-e0dnmk ef1hf1w0" href=# data-qa=BaseLink-renderAnchor-StyledAnchor><p><span data-qa=DigitalArchiveLink-TitleText class="css-66qo9a eeeqn932">Fallen in love with more than one wedding dress? Wear both – JLo did</span></p></a></h3><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">Malle’s collaborative approach was pioneering at the time, especially in such a marketing-driven industry.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">The perfume business has changed dramatically over the last two decades, thanks in no small part to the rise of celebrity fragrances and so-called “niche fragrances”, a category that Malle himself helped create.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">Malle says that in the ’70s you would see about 20 fragrance launches per year, while now it’s more like 3,000, if not more. He recalls how back then fragrances were sold in supermarkets and some of those cheap products were actually good.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">“Just because you were buying a fragrance in a supermarket, it doesn’t mean it was bad,” he says. “Now this segment is gone because people want to buy something more upscale – at least in their minds – and Sephora has replaced the supermarket and sells them like in a supermarket, while celebrity fragrances have replaced supermarket fragrances.”</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/cdn.i-scmp.com/sites/default/files/d8/images/canvas/2022/08/08/6519c2b7-8a82-4d8c-9b0a-79a022ee7ace_50544031.jpg><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">The rise of “niche fragrances”, Malle says, was the result of consumers looking for something unique, but even this category has become saturated with those trying to make a quick buck.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">“Just because it’s niche it’s supposed to be good and different, but it’s not always the case,” he says. “You still have some very good niche ones but I would say 85 per cent are not and just taking advantage of this trend.”</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">Malle doesn’t mince words about the current landscape of the industry and wants to challenge some misconceptions, chief among them the idea that you can’t sell fragrances online, which he calls “profoundly false”.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">“The amount of perfume we sold online during Covid was enormous, so the idea that you can’t sell fragrance on the internet is wrong,” he explains, adding that he and his team came up with AI tools that match customers with the right fragrances for them after they take an online questionnaire.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/cdn.i-scmp.com/sites/default/files/d8/images/canvas/2022/08/08/abe24798-7d6a-4e26-8cc4-63c3e7b73b74_d7491f3d.jpg><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">He explains that it’s quite common for people to buy a box of samples online and then find their preferred scent. He believes this process is more enjoyable than going to an old-school department store where sales assistants are trained to push products, often without real knowledge of what they are selling.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">This is particularly true in markets such as the United States, says Malle, who has very strong opinions about the way different parts of the world relate to fragrances.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">He says that in southern Europe (including France), the Middle East and South America, people embrace fragrances wholeheartedly and can’t get enough of them. Northern Europe, meanwhile, approaches them like commodities – they don’t love them and see wearing perfume as like putting on a shirt or a pair of trousers.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/cdn.i-scmp.com/sites/default/files/d8/images/canvas/2022/08/08/b7c376ef-15c6-47d9-aa6d-8fff1b677c08_1f86279f.jpg><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">Asia, he says, is a very complex region.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">“Many people in our business were traumatised by Japan and made the mistake of believing that Asia is one and the same, but it’s not,” he says.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">Malle is referring to the failure of fragrances to take off in Japan, the first Asian country to embrace Western luxury back in the ’80s and ’90s. He sees the reluctance of Japanese people to wear fragrances as a cultural trait.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">“It’s a civilisation where you’re not allowed to enter someone else’s bubble and [they’re] obsessed with cleanliness. For them, fragrance is used to cover dirt and they often think that foreigners smell,” he says. “A perfume emanates from your body and gets out of your bubble, so everything about fragrance is against Japanese culture.”</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/cdn.i-scmp.com/sites/default/files/d8/images/canvas/2022/08/08/903e0fea-77be-4daf-bdf8-c32ced6b71d5_4c76805f.jpg><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">Malle is at pains to emphasise that Asia is not all the same and points out the differences between each country.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">“South Korea is a big perfume market, not that different from France in a way. They’re quite hedonistic in their choices,” he says. “In Hong Kong they like fresh perfumes because it’s very humid, so [they go for] floral fragrances and freshness that last. They like lilies of the valley and colognes.”</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">Malle is optimistic about the prospects of the Chinese market, which he believes is on fire.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">“In China they love spicy and strong food and have a tradition of heavy fragrances that is sublime,” he says. “They want to relive things that have been eliminated and go back to their roots. The strongest fragrance in our collection, Rose Tonnerre, which has the power of an atomic bomb, is our bestseller there.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">“China is discovering perfumes very quickly and has gone straight to the niche business and the heavy stuff. China is going to become an enormous perfume market like the Mediterranean, but bada** Mediterranean.”</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/cdn.i-scmp.com/sites/default/files/d8/images/canvas/2022/08/08/dc9a0de6-7d2f-4f01-8720-b43137fbfbcc_266418ee.jpg><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">While Editions de Parfums Frédéric Malle has remained true to its niche status – the brand’s portfolio only features 33 fragrances, developed over a little more than two decades – in 2014 the company was acquired by US-based beauty giant Estée Lauder.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">“It hasn’t changed my business so much but what has changed is that we are a bit slower from the moment we finish a fragrance to when we go to market, because there are more procedures involved, but in the end it’s the same,” he says. “They’re not going to kill a golden goose. They don’t want to spoil the quality and the talent.”</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">Malle can’t easily describe what he does in words – “I know how to smell and I’m capable of starting a fragrance from a white sheet of paper, but I’m not a perfumer” – and believes that ultimately, dedication and commitment are the main qualities needed to succeed in such a unique industry.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">“It’s not a sprint, but a marathon,” he says. “You have to love it so much that you have to be very patient. This is a difficult and humbling business.”</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tK%2FMqWWcp51kuaqyxKyrsqSVZLOiv8eipqdlkpqutsDYaJirrJmYuaZ7kmpvcWlgZ3ytwdeuqbJloJq%2Fp8HMnmSpoZ%2Bjsqa%2BjJ%2BpnpyVp7akecyao6WdXZ28tXnCoaCnmV2irrO3xK0%3D</p><h4><i class="fas fa-share-alt" aria-hidden=true></i>&nbsp;Share!</h4><ul class=share-buttons><li><a href="https://www.facebook.com/sharer/sharer.php?u=%2fluxury-perfume-pioneer-frederic-malle-hot-china-market.html" target=_blank title="Share on Facebook"><i class="fab fa-facebook" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Share on Facebook</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="https://twitter.com/intent/tweet?source=%2fluxury-perfume-pioneer-frederic-malle-hot-china-market.html" target=_blank title=Tweet><i class="fab fa-twitter" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Tweet</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="https://plus.google.com/share?url=%2fluxury-perfume-pioneer-frederic-malle-hot-china-market.html" target=_blank title="Share on Google+"><i class="fab fa-google-plus" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Share on Google+</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="http://www.tumblr.com/share?v=3&u=%2fluxury-perfume-pioneer-frederic-malle-hot-china-market.html" target=_blank title="Post to Tumblr"><i class="fab fa-tumblr" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Post to Tumblr</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="http://pinterest.com/pin/create/button/?url=%2fluxury-perfume-pioneer-frederic-malle-hot-china-market.html" target=_blank title="Pin it"><i class="fab fa-pinterest-p" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Pin it</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="http://www.reddit.com/submit?url=%2fluxury-perfume-pioneer-frederic-malle-hot-china-market.html" target=_blank title="Submit to Reddit"><i class="fab fa-reddit-alien" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Submit to Reddit</span></a></li></ul><style>ul.share-buttons{list-style:none;padding:0}ul.share-buttons li{display:inline}ul.share-buttons .sr-only{position:absolute;clip:rect(1px 1px 1px 1px);clip:rect(1px,1px,1px,1px);padding:0;border:0;height:1px;width:1px;overflow:hidden}</style><div class="prev-next-post pure-g"><div class=pure-u-1-24 style=text-align:left><a href=./rivian-r2t-and-r2s-release-specs-rumors-features.html><i class="fa fa-chevron-left"></i></a></div><div class=pure-u-10-24><nav class=prev><a href=./rivian-r2t-and-r2s-release-specs-rumors-features.html>Rivian R2S and R2T: What You Need to Know</a></nav></div><div class=pure-u-2-24>&nbsp;</div><div class=pure-u-10-24><nav class=next><a href=./josha-stradowski.html>Josha Stradowski - Bio, Age, Net Worth, Salary, Single, Facts</a></nav></div><div class=pure-u-1-24 style=text-align:right><a href=./josha-stradowski.html><i class="fa fa-chevron-right"></i></a></div></div></div></div></div><script src=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/blackburn/js/ui.js></script>
