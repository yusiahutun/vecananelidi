To make the sign, you hold up four fingers with your palm facing your chest as though to make a huge ‘W.’&nbsp;</p><p>It is also common for rappers and wannabes to modify the original four-fingers-up sign to a special gesture. They do this by overlacing the ring and middle fingers and leaving the index and pinky fingers up while the thumb is folded into the palm.</p><p>This simple gesture was popularized in the 80s and 90s by famous rappers such as Tupac Shakur. Unlike most trends from that era, this type of gesture has outlasted many rappers and is still quite popular even in 2023, many decades since it was first used.&nbsp;</p><p><a data-amazonimages title="The Death Of Late Rapper MO3" href=# rel="nofollow noopener"><img decoding=async src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/m.media-amazon.com/images/I/515N5zbh43L._SL500_.jpg alt="The Death Of Late Rapper MO3" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto title="Here is why rappers hold up four fingers 2"></a></p><h2 class=wp-block-heading>What Does It Mean When Rappers Hold Up Four Fingers?</h2><p>Urban legend has it that rappers hold four fingers up to ‘represent’ the West Coast or as an alternative gesture for the West Side.</p><p>This special gesture was popularized by rappers from the West Coast, including Snoop Dogg, Dr. Dre, and Tupac Shakur, among others, who would use it along with accented beat gestures while flashing his <a href=# data-type=post data-id=5777>notorious 5-point star ring</a>.</p><p>And let’s not forget about all them gold chains! <a href=# data-type=post data-id=5893>There is a reason</a> why rappers love showing off their cables!</p><p>By holding up four fingers and making a big ‘W’ sign, usually when serenading a crowd, in a music video, or a photograph, a rapper seeks to convey respect for the West Coast homeland or to show solidarity with the people or fans from the West Coast using this type of gesture.</p><p><a data-amazonimages title="How to Rap: The Art and Science of the Hip-Hop MC" href=# rel="nofollow noopener"><img decoding=async src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/m.media-amazon.com/images/I/51t0qOkVMtL._SL500_.jpg alt="How to Rap: The Art and Science of the Hip-Hop MC" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto title="Here is why rappers hold up four fingers 3"></a></p><p>According to a post on the Urban Dictionary, the Westside hand gesture and signal is originally from Florida, where it was used as innocent teenage fun.</p><p>People would hold up four fingers, indicating that they represented the block from which they came from.
