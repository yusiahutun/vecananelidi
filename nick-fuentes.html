<time>08 Feb 2024, 00:00</time></div></div><h2><span id=Nick_Fuentes-_Biography>Nick Fuentes- Biography</span></h2><p><strong>Nick Fuentes</strong> is a white nationalist and far-right American political analyst and live streamer. He is a former YouTuber; in February 2020, his channel was permanently terminated for breaking YouTube’s hate speech policy.</p><h2><span id=Nick_Fuentes-_Birth_Age_Ethnicity_Siblings_Education>Nick Fuentes- Birth, Age, Ethnicity, Siblings, Education</span></h2><p>He was born on August 18, 1998, in the United States of America. We don’t know much about his parents or siblings, but we do know about his education. He went to Lyons Township High School in Illinois. Fuentes was elected as the student council’s president. He later dropped out of Boston University after joining the white supremacist Unite the Right protest in Charlottesville in 2017. In the fall of 2017, he petitioned for transfer admission at Auburn University.</p><p>He is a devout Catholic of Hispanic and Italian origin. Fuentes was a regular speaker at protests and rallies leading up to the storming of the United States Capitol in 2021. His views and point of view are quite far-right and highly contentious. Fuentes is a staunch opponent of immigration, which he sees as a demographic threat to the United States. He has spoken out against the so-called “LGBT agenda.”</p><h2><span id=Nick_Fuentes-_Professional_Career>Nick Fuentes- Professional Career</span></h2><p>He began commenting on politics on a local radio and television channel operated by his high school. This is where he became more mainstream and conservative. He is now hosting America First, an episodic live stream with Nicholas J. Fuentes. It all started in 2017. The stream contains his constant use of ironic humor to pander to Generation Z while simultaneously offering believable denial of his frequently extremist beliefs.</p><p>In 2017, he maintained his position on a variety of issues. The majority of them were incredibly bigoted and unpleasant. According to Fuentes, “the First Amendment was not created for the Saudi Royal Family.” The show’s former publisher, RSBN, apologized. They agreed that the statements were “inappropriate” and “unacceptable.” Fuentes resigned from RSBN in August 2017 in response to these and other comments, as well as media coverage of his attendance at the Unite the Right march.</p><h2><span id=Recent_occurrences>Recent occurrences</span></h2><p>Until January 2018, he co-hosted the Nationalist Review podcast with fellow white nationalist James Allsup. The two had a minor public spat. Fuentes’ YouTube channel was later demonetized in January 2020, and one of his videos was banned by YouTube for violating their hate speech policy.</p><p>He has already been banned from Twitch and Reddit, and his YouTube channel was also canceled in February 2020. After that, he switched to a new streaming network, DLive, which has been chastised for allowing Fuentes to utilize their platform. Except for Twitter, he appears to have been suspended from practically all social media platforms as of 2021.</p><p>In December 2020, at a pro-Trump rally in Washington, D.C., he led a throng in chanting “Destroy the GOP” and pushed people to boycott the United States Senate special runoff election in Georgia. He is also accused of inciting the crowd to attack the White House.</p><p>Also Read, <a href=#>Concetta Monti</a>, <a href=#>Chani Natasha</a>, and <a href=#>Peachprc</a>.</p><span class=tag-title>Related tags :</span> <span class="tags-links clearfix"><a href=# rel=tag>YouTuber</a></span> <a href=#></a><h3 class=small-font><a href=#>Vicky Curiel</a></h3>Who is Vicky Curiel?
