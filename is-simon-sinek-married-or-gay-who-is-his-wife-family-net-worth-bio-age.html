The book, entitled “Begin with the Why: How Great Leaders Inspire Everyone to Act” was a turning point in Simon’s professional career.</p><p>The book made it onto the New York Times bestseller list and was well-received by critics and readers. In the book, Simon spoke about the importance of inspiring people by giving them a sense of purpose. His illustrative concept and the feelings he expressed became a hot topic in leadership groups and established Simon’s career as a motivational speaker and leadership expert.</p><p>Due to the success of the book and the reception of the ideas it conveys, Simon has lectured at various international organizations. He has met and lectured to several leaders from different sectors and industries, from technical executives to government leaders. He has met with leaders from Microsoft, the United States military, the US Congress, etc. Simon and his company Sinek Partners teach fundamentally how to inspire people for leaders and organizations.

Although it is easy to assume that he has a family of his own, there is no information about whether he is married or in a relationship. This has caused speculation that he is gay.
