May you always experience the joy that comes from putting Christ at the centre of your lives.’</span><span style=font-weight:700></span></p>&nbsp;<h3 class=wocc><span style=font-weight:700>THE FRONTRUNNERS TO SUCCEED</span><br></h3><p><span>Cardinal Marc Ouellet, 68, the Canadian head of the Vatican's office for bishops</span></p><p><span>Archbishop of Quebec between 2003 and 2010. He is known as a strong defender of orthodoxy and is said to come from the same school of theological thought as Benedict.</span></p><p><span>Cardinal Gianfranco Ravasi, 70, president of the Pontifical Council for Culture</span></p><p><span>A former academic theologian and Biblical scholar noted for his work encouraging dialogue between believers and non-believers and his 'outreach' to science. He was chosen this year by Benedict to lead the Vatican's Lenten spiritual retreat - a papal favour which could mark him out as a frontrunner.</span></p><p><span>Cardinal Leonardo Sandri, 69, an Argentinian and prefect of the Congregation for the Oriental Churches</span></p><p><span>A 'consummate' Vatican insider and viewed as a pair of 'safe hands', he announced Pope John Paul II's death to the world in April 2005. His experience is said to have given him a special understanding of the experience of Christians in the Middle East including the plight of the Christian population in Iraq following the war in 2003.</span></p><p><span>Cardinal Odilo Scherer, 63, Archbishop of Sao Paulo in Brazil</span></p><p><span>Head of the largest diocese in the world's largest Catholic country. He spent several years working at the congregation for bishops at the Vatican. The German-Brazilian is seen as the strongest Latin American candidate.</span></p><p><span>Cardinal Christoph Schonborn, 68, Archbishop of Vienna</span></p><p><span>An intellectual and a scholar who studied under Pope Benedict and is close to the outgoing pope. He is dealing with a rebellion in Austria by Catholics who are calling for reform of the Church in areas such as priestly celibacy and the role of women. The cardinals may not want to elect two German-speaking popes in a row.</span></p><p><span>Cardinal Angelo Scola, 71, Archbishop of Milan</span></p><p><span>Cardinal Scola was said to have been 'papabile' - a possible contender for pope - during the conclave to replace Pope John Paul II in 2005, and is an influential philosopher and theologian. He is a member of the powerful Congregation for the Doctrine of the Faith responsible for ensuring Catholic orthodoxy.</span></p><p><span>Cardinal Luis Tagle, 55, Archbishop of Manila, Philippines</span></p><p><span>Described by Vatican commentator John Allen as a 'genuine intellectual with a common touch'. He is seen as an outside chance because he is considered too young. If elected he could be pope for more than 30 years.</span></p><p><span>Cardinal Peter Turkson, 64, from Ghana, president of the Pontifical Council for Justice and Peace.</span></p><p><span>Cardinal Turkson is a popular figure and would be the first pope from Africa since Gelasius I more than 1,500 years ago. But the department he heads is not powerful and he has raised eyebrows by his willingness to discuss his chances of becoming pope. He is also seen by some as being gaffe-prone.</span></p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7pa3IpbCmmZmhe6S7ja6iaKaVrMBwrdGtoJyklWJ%2Fc4SWcmpuZ4CkvaZ5w56jmrFdfrqxu9KtnKtllKeytL%2FEnWScmaKZtq%2Bty2aqp52RoMBuosCtoJyZnmJ%2Bc3nCmqmdoZ6WubR5wKupoq6VmXqTu8yeZaGsnaE%3D</p><h4><i class="fas fa-share-alt" aria-hidden=true></i>&nbsp;Share!</h4><ul class=share-buttons><li><a href="https://www.facebook.com/sharer/sharer.php?u=%2fpope-delay-imposter-dressed-cardinal-sneaks-vatican-12-cardinals-arrived-rome-html.html" target=_blank title="Share on Facebook"><i class="fab fa-facebook" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Share on Facebook</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="https://twitter.com/intent/tweet?source=%2fpope-delay-imposter-dressed-cardinal-sneaks-vatican-12-cardinals-arrived-rome-html.html" target=_blank title=Tweet><i class="fab fa-twitter" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Tweet</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="https://plus.google.com/share?url=%2fpope-delay-imposter-dressed-cardinal-sneaks-vatican-12-cardinals-arrived-rome-html.html" target=_blank title="Share on Google+"><i class="fab fa-google-plus" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Share on Google+</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="http://www.tumblr.com/share?v=3&u=%2fpope-delay-imposter-dressed-cardinal-sneaks-vatican-12-cardinals-arrived-rome-html.html" target=_blank title="Post to Tumblr"><i class="fab fa-tumblr" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Post to Tumblr</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="http://pinterest.com/pin/create/button/?url=%2fpope-delay-imposter-dressed-cardinal-sneaks-vatican-12-cardinals-arrived-rome-html.html" target=_blank title="Pin it"><i class="fab fa-pinterest-p" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Pin it</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="http://www.reddit.com/submit?url=%2fpope-delay-imposter-dressed-cardinal-sneaks-vatican-12-cardinals-arrived-rome-html.html" target=_blank title="Submit to Reddit"><i class="fab fa-reddit-alien" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Submit to Reddit</span></a></li></ul><style>ul.share-buttons{list-style:none;padding:0}ul.share-buttons li{display:inline}ul.share-buttons .sr-only{position:absolute;clip:rect(1px 1px 1px 1px);clip:rect(1px,1px,1px,1px);padding:0;border:0;height:1px;width:1px;overflow:hidden}</style><div class="prev-next-post pure-g"><div class=pure-u-1-24 style=text-align:left><a href=./terrence-howard-and-taraji-p-henson.html><i class="fa fa-chevron-left"></i></a></div><div class=pure-u-10-24><nav class=prev><a href=./terrence-howard-and-taraji-p-henson.html>Terrence Howard and Taraji P.
