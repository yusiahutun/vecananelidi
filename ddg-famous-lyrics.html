Many people took to social media to criticize the artist’s decision to release the song which may be about Halle’s rise to fame with <a href=# id=auto-tag_the-little-mermaid data-tag=the-little-mermaid>The Little Mermaid</a> live-action film.</p><p>The two were <a href=# data-type=URL data-id=https://stylecaster.com/gallery/halle-bailey-dating/ rel="noreferrer noopener">linked</a> when they were seen together at an Usher concert in January 2022.&nbsp;Halle was actually a huge fan of <a href=# id=auto-tag_ddg data-tag=ddg>DDG</a> before they started dating when she told&nbsp;<a href=# rel=nofollow>Essence</a>&nbsp;in 2022, “I’ve been a fan of his for years,” she says. “I grew up being on YouTube and would always see the young Black creators and was constantly inspired by them. He was one of them.”</p><p>Related Stories</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/stylecaster.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/kiss-the-girl-new-lyrics.jpg> <img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/stylecaster.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/little-mermaid.png><p>Initially, she lost contact with him, but all roads lead back to love. “I completely forgot about him,” Halle said. “But then I saw that he was dropping music, and I really gravitated toward this one song. Coincidentally he messaged me—and the rest is history.”</p><p>They had their red carpet debut at the 2022 BET Awards and she starred in his music video for the song&nbsp;<a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">“If I Want You.”</a>&nbsp;The couple was embroiled in a couple of cheating scandals that were proven false by the couple themselves.&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;“All these girls the same, ain’t no way,” he wrote in a now-deleted tweet. Fans and even Halle’s older sister Ski theorized the tweet could have been directed towards cheating, but the rapper clarified. “Nobody cheated on nobody btw. Don’t take my tweets too serious.”</p><p>After the rumors emerged,&nbsp;<a rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow" href=#>British Vogue</a>&nbsp;said that she settled the problems with her boyfriend and she then talked about how it affected her outlook on life. “Experiencing deep love for the first time in my life is something I feel has opened a whole new world for me creatively,” she told the publication. “What it feels like to love someone other than your family, like somebody you may not have known two years ago but now they’re the centre of your world. I like all of the scary feelings that come with that. I like the suspense, the not knowing what’s going to happen, and I feel like that’s what I’m supposed to be going through in womanhood.”</p><p>So what exactly are DDG’s “Famous” lyrics about?

The lyrics of DDG’s “Famous” directs to the rapper’s insecurity about a relationship with a famous celebrity.</p><p>He raps,&nbsp;“Filmin’ a movie now you kissing dudes / You know I love you a lot / I don’t give a f— if that s— for promo / I don’t wanna see this s— no more.” It seemingly refers to Halle’s starring role in The Little Mermaid as Ariel and the friendship she has with her on-screen love interest <a href=# id=auto-tag_jonah-hauer-king data-tag=jonah-hauer-king>Jonah Hauer-King</a> who plays Prince Eric in the film.</p><p>The rapper also addressed some red carpet appearances between the co-stars. “Why is y’all holdin’ hands in the photo? / You know I’m insecure, that’s a no-no.” It also seems like he’s still jealous of what she’s doing even though she’s obviously acting. “When you leave the set, do y’all still text each other phone? / Just because they filmin’ it , it don’t mean that it ain’t wrong” Jonah Hauer-King has been in a relationship with <a href=# data-type=URL data-id=https://stylecaster.com/gallery/jonah-hauer-king-dating/ rel="noreferrer noopener">Ellie Fenn</a> since 2019 and his relationship with Halle is strictly platonic.</p><p>After the rap became viral, DDG threatened to <a href=# data-type=URL data-id=https://twitter.com/PontiacMadeDDG/status/1680755601692049408 rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">delete the music video</a> at 1 million views. Many fans came to Halle’s defense against the rapper’s actions. “DDG has done so many things to sabotage Halles career, especially during the Little Mermaid release. I knew he had deep, evil intentions when he leaked that video of Halle cursing. And it’s not to say that she can’t curse or doesn’t curse, but why put that video out there,” one user<a href=# data-type=URL data-id=https://twitter.com/afrorckprincess/status/1680174710921854976 rel=nofollow> tweeted.</a></p><h2 class=wp-block-heading id=ddg-famous-lyrics>DDG “Famous” Lyrics</h2><figure class="wp-block-embed aligncenter is-type-video is-provider-youtube wp-block-embed-youtube"><p><span class=embed-youtube></span></p></figure><p>Here DDG’s “Famous” lyrics via<a href=# data-type=URL data-id=https://genius.com/Ddg-famous-lyrics rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow"> Genius</a>.</p><p>[Chorus]<br>Fall in love, I hate that shit<br>Knockin’ me off my grind, I can’t fuck with relationships (Oh)<br>I ain’t even got enough time in a day for me to chase a bitch (No)<br>I don’t even ask for much, I ask you to do the basic shit (Oh)<br>Hardest thing I did was fall in love with a famous bitch</p><p>[Post-Chorus]<br>Fans all on my penis&nbsp;(Penis) too much stress, don’t need it (Don’t even need it)<br>If you see me tweet, don’t read it, I swear I’ll delete it (I will)<br>Sometimes I feel so defeated, broken hearts repeated (Oh)<br>Said “I love you”, did you mean it?<br>Why don’t I believe it?</p><p>[Verse 1]<br>I’m tryna figure out what we gon’ do<br>How we gon’ get to the top?<br>Filmin’ a movie now you kissing dudes<br>You know I love you a lot<br>I don’t give a fuck if that shit for promo<br>I don’t wanna see this shit no more<br>Why is y’all holdin’ hands in the photo?
