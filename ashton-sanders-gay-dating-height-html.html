Know about the bond Ashton shares with his onscreen character and the details of his personal life.</p><h2 style=text-align:justify>Ashton Sanders's&nbsp;Dating Life</h2><p style=text-align:justify>It may be a strange coincidence that&nbsp;Ashton's famous portrayal of&nbsp;Chiron,&nbsp;a 16-year-old boy struggling&nbsp;with his gay sexuality&nbsp;in Moonlight, talks so much of his real life.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p style=text-align:justify><span id=ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-182 class=ezoic-adpicker-ad></span>Although he has not revealed if he is gay or straight in real life, there are many resemblances&nbsp;between his onscreen character and his life outside the camera.</p><p style=text-align:justify><strong>Read Also:-</strong>&nbsp;<a href=# rel=follow>How Jeff Devlin Is Gay As Married Man With Wife & Family Is Interesting!</a></p><p style=text-align:justify>For instance, like Chiron, Ashton was also bullied as a kid. <span id=ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-180 class=ezoic-adpicker-ad></span></p><p style=text-align:justify>Ashton, who had a crack-addicted mother in the movie, also endured the drug addiction problem of his biological&nbsp;mother. However, he never had to go through the addiction as he was rescued by&nbsp;Amazing Grace Conservatory, a welfare program for black kids, at 12.</p><p style=text-align:justify></p><p style=text-align:justify><span id=ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-181 class=ezoic-adpicker-ad></span><strong>Ashton portrays 16-year-old&nbsp; gay Chiron in Moonlight</strong> (Photo:&nbsp;TheFilmStage.com)</p><p style=text-align:justify>In Moonlight, Ashton's character Chiron starts having more problems with his sexuality once he reaches high school and his feelings for his childhood crush-best friend&nbsp;resurfaces. But, again, his character showed the struggle of finding out him being gay.&nbsp;</p><p style=text-align:justify>Chiron further develops a special bond (not sexual) with a Cuban drug dealer, Juan (played by&nbsp;Mahershala Ali), who is a fatherly figure to him.

Ashton is dating a girl named Kvmvni, according to an online source.</p><p>However, he has remained tight-lipped about his girlfriend's personal life and makes every effort to keep his dating life out of the public eye.</p><p>His fans were delighted to learn of his girlfriend, but many believe he only dates someone to avoid gay rumors. <span id=ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-631 class=ezoic-adpicker-ad></span></p><p>Regardless, we won't know if he's gay or straight until Ashton clears&nbsp;all suspicions.</p><h2 style=text-align:justify>Ashton Sanders's Career&nbsp;</h2><p style=text-align:justify><span id=ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-186 class=ezoic-adpicker-ad></span>Ashton, who played one of the lead roles in the Oscar-award-winning movie Moonlight, was born in&nbsp;Inglewood, Los Angeles.</p><p style=text-align:justify>He was raised by his father, who worked as a fashion designer, whereas his mother was a junkie who was mostly estranged from her son.&nbsp;</p><p style=text-align:justify>Ashton, who stands at 6'&nbsp;(1.83&nbsp;m), describes his father as his manager and is close to him. Moreover, his dad was the one who enrolled him in acting school, which shaped Ashton's career as an actor. <span id=ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-629 class=ezoic-adpicker-ad></span></p><p style=text-align:justify><strong>Learn About:&nbsp;</strong><a href=# rel=follow>Openly Gay Actor Nicco Annan Talks about His Portrayal In P-Valley</a></p><p style=text-align:justify>Ashton is now enjoying a successful acting career and has performed in several movies, including The Retrieval,&nbsp;Straight Outta Compton, and The Equalizer 2,&nbsp;and is set to be in an upcoming film Captive State.</p><p style=text-align:justify>From his high-end career, he colored his career full of awards comprising the Gotham Special Jury Award for Ensemble Performance (2016),&nbsp;Independent Spirit Robert Altman Award (2017), and&nbsp;MTV Movie Award for Best Kiss (2017).&nbsp;</p><p>The exact amount of his net worth is also not disclosed; however, as Ashton has played in some successful movies in the past years, he has possibly garnered a seven-figure net worth. <span id=ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-630 class=ezoic-adpicker-ad></span></p><p>Stay <a href=# rel=follow>tuned</a>&nbsp;to get more updates on&nbsp;Ashton Sanders.</p><span class="ezoic-autoinsert-ad ezoic-incontent_6"></span><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmikmauys63MqaypZpOkunCxza2cq6yRnruusc2tZpqrmKm8r3nSmqWdnaKoeqit2GabmqyZo7RutMSinqGsXp3Brrg%3D</p><h4><i class="fas fa-share-alt" aria-hidden=true></i>&nbsp;Share!</h4><ul class=share-buttons><li><a href="https://www.facebook.com/sharer/sharer.php?u=%2fashton-sanders-gay-dating-height-html.html" target=_blank title="Share on Facebook"><i class="fab fa-facebook" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Share on Facebook</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="https://twitter.com/intent/tweet?source=%2fashton-sanders-gay-dating-height-html.html" target=_blank title=Tweet><i class="fab fa-twitter" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Tweet</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="https://plus.google.com/share?url=%2fashton-sanders-gay-dating-height-html.html" target=_blank title="Share on Google+"><i class="fab fa-google-plus" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Share on Google+</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="http://www.tumblr.com/share?v=3&u=%2fashton-sanders-gay-dating-height-html.html" target=_blank title="Post to Tumblr"><i class="fab fa-tumblr" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Post to Tumblr</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="http://pinterest.com/pin/create/button/?url=%2fashton-sanders-gay-dating-height-html.html" target=_blank title="Pin it"><i class="fab fa-pinterest-p" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Pin it</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="http://www.reddit.com/submit?url=%2fashton-sanders-gay-dating-height-html.html" target=_blank title="Submit to Reddit"><i class="fab fa-reddit-alien" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Submit to Reddit</span></a></li></ul><style>ul.share-buttons{list-style:none;padding:0}ul.share-buttons li{display:inline}ul.share-buttons .sr-only{position:absolute;clip:rect(1px 1px 1px 1px);clip:rect(1px,1px,1px,1px);padding:0;border:0;height:1px;width:1px;overflow:hidden}</style><div class="prev-next-post pure-g"><div class=pure-u-1-24 style=text-align:left><a href=./hailey-bieber-nepo-baby-tshirt.html><i class="fa fa-chevron-left"></i></a></div><div class=pure-u-10-24><nav class=prev><a href=./hailey-bieber-nepo-baby-tshirt.html>Hailey Bieber hits back at critics in 'Nepo Baby' T-shirt and the internet has gone wild</a></nav></div><div class=pure-u-2-24>&nbsp;</div><div class=pure-u-10-24><nav class=next><a href=./7-moments-from-boxed-in-criminal-minds-s10-e5.html>7 Moments From &amp;quot;Boxed In&amp;quot;</a></nav></div><div class=pure-u-1-24 style=text-align:right><a href=./7-moments-from-boxed-in-criminal-minds-s10-e5.html><i class="fa fa-chevron-right"></i></a></div></div></div></div></div><script src=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/blackburn/js/ui.js></script>
