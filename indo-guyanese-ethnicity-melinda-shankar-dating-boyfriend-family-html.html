But is the love from the viewers only sufficient for the lady to survive or has she secretively mounted a love life with an anonymous person? <span id=ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-606 class=ezoic-adpicker-ad></span></p><span class="ezoic-autoinsert-ad ezoic-under_first_paragraph"></span><p>Just for the sake of the fans and viewers of Melinda, we are unlocking the few personal details of the star’s family background and dating history.</p><h2>Has she found a&nbsp;boyfriend or is she still waiting?</h2><p>The 24 years old actress was seen romancing Luke Bilyk in the series of Degrassi: The Next Generation(2001). Even though the on-screen match created a sizzling chemistry between the pair but in real life, the actress seems to have a different preference and has no intention of dating her co-star behind the screen.</p><p>Thus, as&nbsp;<a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">posted</a> by whosdatedwho.com, she is single. <span id=ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-607 class=ezoic-adpicker-ad></span></p><p>As per our reports the lady had dated a fellow named D.Hundy since 24th December 2013. The lady has not disclosed any information about her meeting with her man nor has she revealed any of her dating incidences in any of the social networking sites or any online portal.</p><p>Even though the lady has not confirmed her relationship&nbsp;with her man, one of her fans tweeted a&nbsp;post on her Twitter account. She&nbsp;mentioned about loving the star and her boyfriend on 21st May 2013. <span id=ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-608 class=ezoic-adpicker-ad></span></p><span class="ezoic-autoinsert-ad ezoic-under_second_paragraph"></span><p><img alt height=191 src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/liverampup.com//uploads/images/indo-guyanese-tweet.jpg width=500 style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center></p><span class="ezoic-autoinsert-ad ezoic-mid_content"></span>&nbsp;<p>Similarly, while going through the man's Twitter, we came across plenty of candid pictures taken with her. Some fans have even appreciated their relationship by showering with loads of best wishes in the relationship and by posting cozy shots of man and women in the Twitter account as on 18th June 2014.</p>&nbsp;<p>Therefore, the lady might be still in the relationship with her handsome&nbsp;man, or they might have moved on in their direction.&nbsp;<span style="background-color:#f9f9f9;color:#333;font-family:helvetica neue,helvetica,arial,sans-serif;font-size:14px">&nbsp;</span>Melinda&nbsp;has seriously confined her relationship status from the media. Thus, we must wait till the lady officially confirms the news about her involvement with the man or their break up. <span id=ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-609 class=ezoic-adpicker-ad></span></p><h2>Melinda's Dating&nbsp;History:</h2><p>While fumbling through her dating history, the actress has a long list of co-star whom she has dated within an interval of a year or two. Even though she has made no certainty, the sources have disclosed her to be involved with plenty of men.&nbsp;</p><p>In the recent year's she was&nbsp;caught in the rumor of dating Raymond Ablack, the Degrassi actor. The lady has neither&nbsp;confirmed&nbsp;the dating news nor has she refused or made any comment to the rumors. <span id=ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-611 class=ezoic-adpicker-ad></span></p><span class="ezoic-autoinsert-ad ezoic-mid_content"></span><p>However, the fan has loved the pair of the couple and is willing to see them together. While some even say that they are engaged.&nbsp;</p><p>Well, till date not a word of acceptance has been received from the star so this just a rumor with no particular evidence. Raymond is reported to be single&nbsp;as of now, but we never know when the status of him will change.</p><p><img alt height=448 src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/liverampup.com//uploads/images/Melinda%20Shankar%20with%20Raymond%20Black.jpg width=600 style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center> <span id=ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-612 class=ezoic-adpicker-ad></span></p><p><strong>Source: Melinda Shankar with Raymond Ablack.</strong></p><p>Source: fanpop.com</p><p>Similarly, there was a rumor of Melinda dating her co-star from Degrassi Justin Kelly from the year 2011.

But, as no news or concrete evidence has been obtained this can also be a fake rumor spread in the media or it might also be true. But the lady in no desire to spread her break up stories in any of the portals and the man is reported to be currently single.</p><p>The actress has kept her love life quite wrapped up. Therefore not a single reason for her breakup with all the men has been&nbsp;out along with the reason for dating men for a short span of time. <span id=ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-636 class=ezoic-adpicker-ad></span></p><p>Maybe the reason for the break up is due to her teenage hormonal change or due to the failure of meeting her Mr.Right or may be attributable to her career.</p><h2>Get to know about her Ethnicity family background:</h2><p><a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">Born to Indo-Guyanese</a> parents who immigrated to Canada,<strong> </strong>Melinda Shankar comes from the family background of actress mother, director grandfather and production manager father.She even mentioned about her grandmother being an actress.
