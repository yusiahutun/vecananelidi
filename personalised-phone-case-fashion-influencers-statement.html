How it looks is equally important, which is why the fashion industry – always on the lookout for new categories to explore and capitalise on – has been quick to embrace the trend. So while luxury phone cases have always been available at established brands such as Louis Vuitton and Chanel, now we’re seeing the rise of specialist brands that are dedicated to transforming the phone case into a personal style statement.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/cdn.i-scmp.com/sites/default/files/d8/images/methode/2019/05/28/0c330d64-7085-11e9-b91a-87f62b76a5ee_972x_124944.jpg><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">“The industry is reacting to this demand as many fashion brands have been offering phone cases for many seasons. Now it’s about creating an entry price piece of luxury that will induce hype and buzz through aspirational customers and on social media platforms,” says Tawny Leung, buying manager at Lane Crawford.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">One such brand is Hong Kong-based Casetify, which now boasts fans including celebrities like Kylie Jenner and Gigi Hadid. The brand was established in 2011. Founder and former PCCW executive Wesley Ng was convinced that the iPhone would become an irreplaceable part of people’s daily lives and wanted to create a line of accessories that would complement it. After failing to find a case that he liked himself, he launched a platform through which customers could personalise a range of different styles.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/cdn.i-scmp.com/sites/default/files/d8/images/methode/2019/05/28/92bfd12e-7084-11e9-b91a-87f62b76a5ee_972x_124944.jpg><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">“The great thing about phone cases is that they appeal to different demographics. On one end we have the Gen Z, who are all about themselves and want to design a case with their picture or word that represents them. Then you have an older demographic like the soccer mum who wants her kid’s picture on her case. A phone case is the perfect place to express anything because it’s so versatile. It’s not necessarily about being fashionable, but more about expressing who you are,” says Ng.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">Ng’s vision has proven so successful that he has attracted and collaborated with a range of high-profile brands and influencers including Sacai, Saint Laurent, Thom Browne, Vetements, and more recently, Sarah Jessica Parker. While the brand is available mainly online, this month sees the launch of the first Casetify Studio pop-up at the Landmark Central, where customers can design and print their own cases in just 15 minutes.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">Customisation has also proven to be a winning formula for Chaos, which has become a firm favourite with fashion editors and media types. Launched by stylists Charlotte Stockdale and Katie Lyall in 2016, their personalised phone cases became a fashion must-have after they went viral on Instagram.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/cdn.i-scmp.com/sites/default/files/d8/images/methode/2019/05/28/868ceacc-80fb-11e9-bda2-8286175bc410_1320x770_124944.jpg><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">“Cases are needed for protection, but at Chaos we believe your phone case should be as cool and covetable as the shoes you wear or the bag you may carry it in. In fact, we see more of our mobiles during the day in their cases than we do our Chanel handbag or Balenciaga trainers. So on top of looking good while performing a protective function, it has become a status symbol,” say Stockdale and Lyall.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">While Casetify attracts customers with its kitschy DHL labels, Chaos’ look is definitely more understated, as evidenced by its bestselling initial cases made from deerskin. The brand has ve expanded into other tech related accessories including phone straps, clutches, laptop covers, and adaptor covers.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">“We do not see [the demand for the phone case] flatlining, but the buyer may well become more discerning. We feel that offering a lifestyle around our brand is very important, which is why we are growing the Chaos Club with extra products that work around the phone case,” say Lyall and Stockdale.</p><figure data-qa=Component-StyledFigure class="css-1yuz473 exv1azg4">A phone case is the perfect place to express anything because it’s so versatile. It’s not necessarily about being fashionable, but more about expressing who you areWesley Ng, Casetify founder</figure><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">Ng has also widened Casetify’s scope by offering tech-related accessories, although he says that the phone case still offers endless possibilities. Recent bestsellers include its reversible sequin cases (inspired by a popular fashion technique) and mirror cases. Later this month Ng will launch the Co-Lab programme featuring co-branded capsules from brands, artists and tastemakers around the world. Co-curators include Sarah Andelman of Colette, who will invite six designers to participate.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">“The moment we started this business, people questioned our longevity. Fast forward eight years, and the market is here to stay. Look at technology breakthroughs – they don’t come every five to 10 years, they take much more time. Of course there may be new things to replace your mobile phone, but we still have a long way to go. In the meantime we will make the best tech accessories including phone cases that allow people to express who they are. People always want to express themselves,” he says.</p><p>This article appeared in the South China Morning Post print edition as: Smartphone cases – now it’s personalfashion’s</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tK%2FMqWWcp51kuaqyxKyrsqSVZLOiv8eipqdlkpqutsDYaJirrJmYuaZ7kmloa2hmZnyxsdGspqeZnJ7AprCMqZ%2BoppVisKK%2FxGadmquYnryvecinnaWtlaOwpr7SZqqtmaSauqa60w%3D%3D</p><h4><i class="fas fa-share-alt" aria-hidden=true></i>&nbsp;Share!</h4><ul class=share-buttons><li><a href="https://www.facebook.com/sharer/sharer.php?u=%2fpersonalised-phone-case-fashion-influencers-statement.html" target=_blank title="Share on Facebook"><i class="fab fa-facebook" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Share on Facebook</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="https://twitter.com/intent/tweet?source=%2fpersonalised-phone-case-fashion-influencers-statement.html" target=_blank title=Tweet><i class="fab fa-twitter" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Tweet</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="https://plus.google.com/share?url=%2fpersonalised-phone-case-fashion-influencers-statement.html" target=_blank title="Share on Google+"><i class="fab fa-google-plus" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Share on Google+</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="http://www.tumblr.com/share?v=3&u=%2fpersonalised-phone-case-fashion-influencers-statement.html" target=_blank title="Post to Tumblr"><i class="fab fa-tumblr" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Post to Tumblr</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="http://pinterest.com/pin/create/button/?url=%2fpersonalised-phone-case-fashion-influencers-statement.html" target=_blank title="Pin it"><i class="fab fa-pinterest-p" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Pin it</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="http://www.reddit.com/submit?url=%2fpersonalised-phone-case-fashion-influencers-statement.html" target=_blank title="Submit to Reddit"><i class="fab fa-reddit-alien" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Submit to Reddit</span></a></li></ul><style>ul.share-buttons{list-style:none;padding:0}ul.share-buttons li{display:inline}ul.share-buttons .sr-only{position:absolute;clip:rect(1px 1px 1px 1px);clip:rect(1px,1px,1px,1px);padding:0;border:0;height:1px;width:1px;overflow:hidden}</style><div class="prev-next-post pure-g"><div class=pure-u-1-24 style=text-align:left><a href=./taylor-swift-beauty-tips.html><i class="fa fa-chevron-left"></i></a></div><div class=pure-u-10-24><nav class=prev><a href=./taylor-swift-beauty-tips.html>She Once Used Sharpie As Eyeliner</a></nav></div><div class=pure-u-2-24>&nbsp;</div><div class=pure-u-10-24><nav class=next><a href=./kelly-clarkson-41-looks-gorgeous-green-dress-losing-stunning-weight-post-divorce-making-healthier-choices-html.html>Kelly Clarkson, 41, looks gorgeous in a green dress... after losing a stunning amount of weight post</a></nav></div><div class=pure-u-1-24 style=text-align:right><a href=./kelly-clarkson-41-looks-gorgeous-green-dress-losing-stunning-weight-post-divorce-making-healthier-choices-html.html><i class="fa fa-chevron-right"></i></a></div></div></div></div></div><script src=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/blackburn/js/ui.js></script>
